<h2 id='setGeneric'>Define a New Generic Function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a new generic function of the given name, for which formal
methods can then be defined.  Typically, an existing non-generic
function becomes the default method, but there is much optional
control.  See the details section.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>setGeneric(name, def, group=NULL, valueClass=NULL, where=1, doAssign,
           myDispatch = FALSE, useAsDefault)

setGroupGeneric(name, def, group=NULL, valueClass=NULL, knownMembers, where=1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_name">name</code></td>
<td>
<p> The character string name of the generic function.  In
the simplest and most common case, a function of this name is
already defined.  The existing function may be non-generic or
already a generic (see the details).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_def">def</code></td>
<td>
<p> An optional function object, defining the generic.  This
argument is usually only needed (and is then required) if there is
no current function of this name. In that case, the formal arguments
and default values for the generic are taken from <code>def</code>.  The
body will be set to the standard dispatch mechanism, unless you want
to do something different (use argument <code>myDispatch</code> in this
case.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>def</code> is <em>not</em> the default method; use argument
<code>useAsDefault</code> if you want to specify the default separately.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_group">group</code></td>
<td>
<p> Optionally, a character string giving the group of
generic functions to which this function belongs.  Methods can be
defined for the corresponding group generic, and these will then
define methods for this specific generic function, if no method has
been explicitly defined for the corresponding signature.  See the
references for more discussion.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_valueClass">valueClass</code></td>
<td>
<p> An optional character vector or unevaluated 
expression.  The value returned by the generic function must
have (or extend) this class, or one of the classes; otherwise,
an error is generated.  See the
details section for supplying an expression.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_where">where</code></td>
<td>
<p> Where to store the resulting initial methods definition,
and possibly the generic function; by
default, stored into the global environment.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_doAssign">doAssign</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>You can supply <code>doAssign</code> as <code>TRUE</code> to force assigning a
generic function even if one already exists. See the details
section. The rule of not assigning
generics for primitives cannot be overriden by setting
<code>doAssign</code> to <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_myDispatch">myDispatch</code></td>
<td>

<p>Normally, the body of a generic function does nothing except to
dispatch methods (via a call to <code>standardGeneric</code>).  The
evaluation model, however, allows the generic to do any other
computation it wants, it it calls <code>standardGeneric</code> at
some point.  Otherwise, <code>setGeneric</code> will ignore the body of
the supplied generic unless <code>myDispatch</code> is set to
<code>TRUE</code>. See the details section.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_useAsDefault">useAsDefault</code></td>
<td>

<p>Override the usual choice of default argument (an existing
non-generic function or no default if there is no such function).
Argument <code>useAsDefault</code> can be supplied,
either as a function to use for the default, or as a logical value.
<code>FALSE</code> says not to have a default method at all, so that an
error occurs if there is not an explicit or inherited method for a
call.
<code>TRUE</code> says to use the existing function as default,
unconditionally (hardly ever needed as an explicit argument).
See the section on details.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setGeneric_:_knownMembers">knownMembers</code></td>
<td>

<p>(For <code>setGroupGeneric</code> only)  The names of functions that are known to be
members of this group.  This information is used to reset cached
definitions of the member generics when information about the group
generic is changed.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>setGeneric</code> function is called to initialize a generic
function in an environment (usually the global environment), as
preparation for defining some methods for that function.
</p>
<p>The simplest and most common situation is that <code>name</code> is already
an ordinary non-generic function, and you now want to turn this
function into a generic.
In this
case you will most often supply only <code>name</code>.  The existing
function becomes the default method, and the special <code>group</code> and
<code>valueClass</code> properties remain unspecified.
</p>
<p>A second situation is that you want to create a new, generic
function, unrelated to any existing function.  In this case, you
need to supply a skeleton of the function definition, to define the
arguments for the function.  The body of a generic function is
usually a standard form, <code>standardGeneric(name)</code> where
<code>name</code> is the quoted name of the generic function.
</p>
<p>When calling <code>setGeneric</code> in this form, you would normally
supply the <code>def</code> argument as a function of this form.  If not
told otherwise, <code>setGeneric</code> will try to find a non-generic
version of the function to use as a default.  If you don't want this
to happen, supply the argument <code>useAsDefault</code>.  That argument
can be the function you want to be the default method.  You can supply
the argument as <code>FALSE</code> to force no default (i.e., to cause an error if
there is not direct or inherited method on call to the function).
</p>
<p>The same no-default situation occurs if there is no non-generic form of the function, and
<code>useAsDefault</code> does not supply one.  Remember, though, you can
also just assign the default you want (even one that generates an
error) rather than relying on the prior situation.
</p>
<p>Usually, calling <code>setGeneric</code> if there is already a
<em>generic</em> function of this name has no effect.  If you want to
force a new definition, supply <code>doAssign = TRUE</code> (but it would
be cleaner in most cases to remove the old generic before creating
the new one; see <code>removeGeneric</code>).  There is one
absolute restriction:  you cannot create an explicit generic for the
primitive functions in the base library.  These are dispatched from
C code for efficiency and, also, are implicitly not to be redefined
in any case.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, the body of a generic function usually does nothing
except for dispatching methods by a call to <code>standardGeneric</code>.
Under some circumstances you might just want to do some additional
computation in the generic function itself.  As long as your
function eventually calls <code>standardGeneric</code> that is permissible
(though perhaps not a good idea, in that it makes the behavior of
your function different from the usual S model).  If your function
does <em>not</em> call <code>standardGeneric</code> you are in trouble,
because none of the methods for the function will ever be
dispatched.  The computations in <code>setGeneric</code> look for such a
call, and normally ignore the body of a <code>def</code> argument that
has no such call.  If you really need to supply such a definition
(perhaps because you call something else that calls
<code>standardGeneric</code>), you can force the use of <code>def</code> by
supplying <code>myDispatch = TRUE</code>.
By default, the generic function can return any object.
</p>
<p>If <code>valueClass</code> is supplied, it can be either a vector of
class names or an unevaluated expression.  If an unevaluated expression is supplied (e.g., by using
<code>quote</code>), the expression will be evaluated in the frame
of the call to the generic function, after the method is
dispatched.  Therefore, the expression can involve any argument or
locally defined object in that frame.
The test is done in the form
<code>is(object, class)</code>, so that a value from a class that extends
a supplied value class will be accepted.
An empty (i.e., zero length) vector of classes means anything is
allowed (but it would be clearer programming to have an expression that
evaluated to <code>"ANY"</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>setGroupGeneric</code> function behaves like <code>setGeneric</code> except that
it constructs a group generic function, differing in two ways from an
ordinary generic function.  First,
this function cannot be called directly, and the body of the function
created will contain a stop call with this information.  Second, the
group generic function contains information about the known members of
the group, used to keep the members up to date when the group
definition changes, through changes in the search list or direct
specification of methods, etc.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>setGeneric</code> function exists for its side effect: saving the
generic function to allow methods to be specified later.  It returns
<code>name</code>.
