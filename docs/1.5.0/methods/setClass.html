<h2 id='setClass'>Create a Class Definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a formally defined class with specified slots and/or
relationships to other classes.  Also functions to remove a class
definition, to test whether a class has been defined, to test whether
an object is a class definition, and to reset the internal definition
of a class.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>setClass(Class, representation, prototype,
         contains=character(), validity, access, where=1, version=FALSE)

removeClass(Class, where=-1)

isClass(Class, formal=TRUE)
isClassDef(object)

getClasses(where)

resetClass(Class)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_Class">Class</code></td>
<td>
<p> character string name for the class </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_representation">representation</code></td>
<td>
<p> the slots that the new class should have
and/or other classes that this class extends.  Usually a call to
the <code>representation</code> function. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_prototype">prototype</code></td>
<td>
<p> an object (usually a list) providing the default
data for the slots specified in the representation. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_contains">contains</code></td>
<td>
<p> what classes does this class extend?  (These are
called <em>superclasses</em> in some languages.)  When these classes
have slots, all their slots will be contained in the new class as
well. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_where">where</code></td>
<td>
<p> What environment to use to store or remove the
definition (as metadata).
By default, uses the global environment for <code>setClass</code> and
searches for a definition to remove, for <code>removeClass</code>. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These are the functions that create and manipulate formal class
definitions.  Brief documentation is provided below.  See the
references for an introduction and for more details.
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt><code>setClass</code>:</dt><dd> 
<p>Define <code>Class</code> to be an S-style class.  The effect is to
create an object, of class <code>"classRepEnvironment"</code>, and store
this (hidden) in the specified environment or database.  Objects
can be created from the class (e.g., by calling
<code>new</code>), manipulated (e.g., by accessing the object's
slots), and methods may be defined including the class name in the
signature (see <code>setMethod</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>removeClass</code>:</dt><dd> 
<p>Remove the definition of this class.  Calling this <em>always</em>
resets the version of the class cached for the session.  If
<code>where=0</code>, that's all it does.  Otherwise, it removes the
version from the specified environment or database (from the global
environment by default).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>isClass</code>:</dt><dd> 
<p>Is this a the name of a formally defined class? (Argument
<code>formal</code> is for compatibility and is ignored.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>isClassDef</code>:</dt><dd> 
<p>Is this object a class definition (it will be, for example, if it
is the value of a call to <code>getClass</code>, the complete
definition of a class with its extensions, or to
<code>getClassDef</code>, the local definition of the class).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>getClasses</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>The names of all the classes formally defined on <code>where</code>.  If
called with no argument, all the classes currently known in the
session (which does not include classes that may be defined on one
of the attached packages, but have not yet been used in the
session).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>unclass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Returns the object containing the values of all the slots in this
object's class definition (specifically, if the returned object
has attributes corresponding to each slot), in the case that the
object's class is formally defined with slots.  For classes that
extend a single other class (e.g., a basic class such as
<code>"numeric"</code>) the result is an object of that class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>resetClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Reset the internal definition of a class.  The effect is that
the next time the definition of this class is needed, it will be
recomputed from the information in the currently attached packages.
</p>
<p>This function is called when aspects of the class definition are
changed.  You would need to call it explicitly if you changed the
definition of a class that this class extends (but doing that in
the  middle of a session is living dangerously, since it may
invalidate existing objects).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Inheritance and Prototypes</h3>

<p>Defining new classes that inherit from (&ldquo;extend&rdquo;) other classes is a
powerful technique, but has to be used carefully and not over-used.
Otherwise, you will often get unintended results when you start to
compute with objects from the new class.
</p>
<p>As shown in the examples below, the simplest and safest form of
inheritance is to start with an explicit class, with some slots, that
does not extend anything else.  It only does what we say it does.
</p>
<p>Then extensions will add some new slots and new behavior.
</p>
<p>Another variety of extension starts with one of the basic classes,
perhaps with the intension of modifying R's standard behavior for that
class.  Perfectly legal and sometimes quite helpful, but you may need
to be more careful in this case:  your new class will inherit much of
the behavior of the basic (informally defined) class, and the results
can be surprising.  Just proceed with caution and plenty of testing.
</p>
<p>As an example, the class <code>"matrix"</code> is included in the
pre-defined classes, to behave essentially as matrices do without
formal class definitions.  Suppose we don't like all of this; in
particular, we want the default matrix to have 0 rows and columns (not
1 by 1 as it is now).
</p>
<p><code>setClass("myMatrix", "matrix", prototype = matrix(0,0,0))</code>
</p>
<p>The arguments above illustrate two short-cuts relevant to such
examples.  We abbreviated the <code>representation</code> argument to the
single superclass, because the new class doesn't add anything to the
representation of class <code>"matrix"</code>.  Also, we provided an object
from the superclass as the prototype, not a list of slots.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
## A simple class with two slots
setClass("track",
            representation(x="numeric", y="numeric"))
## A class extending the previous, adding one more slot
setClass("trackCurve",
            representation("track", smooth = "numeric"))
## A class similar to "trackCurve", but with different structure
## allowing matrices for the "y" and "smooth" slots
setClass("trackMultiCurve", representation(x="numeric", y="matrix", smooth="matrix"),
          prototype = list(x=numeric(), y=matrix(0,0,0), smooth= matrix(0,0,0)))
##
## Suppose we want  trackMultiCurve to be like trackCurve when there's only
## one column
## First, the wrong way. 
try(setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
  test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1}))

## why didn't that work?  You can only override the slots "x", "y", and "smooth"
## if you provide an explicit coerce function to correct any inconsistencies:

setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
  test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1},
  coerce = function(obj) { new("trackCurve", x = slot(obj, "x"),
        y = as.numeric(slot(obj,"y")), smooth = as.numeric(slot(obj, "smooth")))})
