<h2 id='callNextMethod'>Call an Inherited Method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A call to <code>callNextMethod</code> can only appear inside a method
definition.  It then results in a call to the first inherited method
after the current method, with the arguments to the current method
passed down to the next method.  The value of that method call is the
value of <code>callNextMethod</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>callNextMethod(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="callNextMethod_:_...">...</code></td>
<td>

<p>If included, the call to the next methods uses these as its arguments
(but note that the dispatch is as described below.)  The
recommendation for most applications is to use <code>callNextMethod</code>
with no explicit arguments.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The definition of the first inherited method is that is the method
which <em>would</em> have been called if the current method did not
exist.
This is more-or-less literally what happens: The current method is
deleted from a copy of the methods for the current generic, and
<code>selectMethod</code> is called to find the next method (the
result is cached in a special object, so the search only typically
happens once per session per combination of argument classes).
</p>
<p>It is also legal, and often useful, for the method called by
<code>callNextMethod</code> to itself have a call to <code>callNextMethod</code>.  This
works the same way, except that now two methods are deleted before
selecting the next method, and so on for further nested calls to
<code>callNextMethod</code>.
</p>
<p>The statement that the method is called with the current arguments is
more precisely as follows.  Arguments that were missing in the current
call are still missing (remember that <code>"missing"</code> is a valid
class in a method signature).  For a formal argument, say <code>x</code>, that
appears in the original call, there is a corresponding argument in the
next method call equivalent to &ldquo;<code>x = x</code>&rdquo;.  In effect, this
means that the next method sees the same actual arguments, but
arguments are evaluated only once.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value returned by the selected method.
</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p>The R package <code>methods</code> implements, with a few exceptions, the
programming interface for classes
and methods in the book <em>Programming with Data</em> (John
M. Chambers, Springer, 1998), in particular sections 1.6, 2.7, 2.8,
and chapters 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>While the programming interface for the methods package follows the reference,
the R software is an original implementation, so details in
the reference that reflect the S4 implementation may appear
differently in R.  Also, there are extensions to the programming
interface developed more recently than the reference.  For a
discussion of details and ongoing development, see the web page 
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/methodsPackage.html">http://developer.r-project.org/methodsPackage.html</a> and the
pointers from that page.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
## some class definitions with simple inheritance
setClass("B0" , representation(b0 = "numeric"))

setClass("B1", "B0")

setClass("B2", representation("B1", b2 = "logical"))

## and a rather silly function to illustrate callNextMethod

f &lt;- function(x) class(x)

setMethod("f", "B0", function(x) c(x@b0, callNextMethod()))

setMethod("f", "B2", function(x) c(x@b2, callNextMethod()))

b2 &lt;- new("B2", b2 = FALSE, b0 = 10)

b1 &lt;- new("B1", b0 = 2)

f(b2)

f(b1)
