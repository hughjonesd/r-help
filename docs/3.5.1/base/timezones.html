<h2>Time Zones</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Information about time zones in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  <code>Sys.timezone</code> returns
the name of the current time zone.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)

OlsonNames(tzdir = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="location">location</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: defunct: ignored, with a warning for false values.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="tzdir">tzdir</code></td>
<td>
<p>The time-zone database to be used: the default is to try
known locations until one is found.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Time zones are a system-specific topic, but these days almost all <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
platforms use similar underlying code, used by Linux, macOS, Solaris,
AIX and FreeBSD, and installed with <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> on Windows.  (Unfortunately
there are many system-specific errors in the implementations.)  It is
possible to use the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> sources' version of the code on Unix-alikes as
well as on Windows: this is the default for macOS and recommended for
Solaris.
</p>
<p>It should be possible to set the current time zone via the environment
variable <span class="env">TZ</span>: see the section on &lsquo;Time zone names&rsquo; for
suitable values.  <code>Sys.timezone()</code> will return the value of
<span class="env">TZ</span> if set initially (and on some OSes it is always set),
otherwise it will try to retrieve from the OS a value which if set for
<span class="env">TZ</span> would give the initial time zone. (&lsquo;Initially&rsquo; means
before any time-zone functions are used: if <span class="env">TZ</span> is being set to
override the OS setting or if the &lsquo;try&rsquo; does not get this
right, it should be set before the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> process is started or (probably
early enough) in file <code>.Rprofile</code>).
</p>


<p>If <span class="env">TZ</span> is set but invalid, most platforms default to &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;UTC&#8288;</span>&rsquo;,
the time zone colloquially known as &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;GMT&#8288;</span>&rsquo; (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time</a>).
(Some but not all platforms will give a warning for invalid values.)
If it is unset or empty the <em>system</em> time zone is used (the one
returned by <code>Sys.timezone</code>).
</p>
<p>Time zones did not come into use until the second half of the
nineteenth century and were not widely adopted until the twentieth,
and <em>daylight saving time</em> (DST, also known as <em>summer
time</em>) was first introduced in the early twentieth century, most
widely in 1916.  Over the last 100 years places have changed their
affiliation between major time zones, have opted out of (or in to) DST
in various years or adopted DST rule changes late or not at all.  (The
UK experimented with DST throughout 1971, only.)
</p>
<p>A quite common system implementation of <code>POSIXct</code> is as signed
32-bit integers and so only goes back to the end of 1901: on such
systems <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> assumes that dates prior to that are in the same time zone
as they were in 1902.  Most of the world had not adopted time zones by
1902 (so used local &lsquo;mean time&rsquo; based on longitude) but for a
few places there had been time-zone changes before then.  64-bit
representations are becoming common; unfortunately on some 64-bit OSes
(notably macOS) the database information is 32-bit and so only
available for the range 1901&ndash;2038, and incompletely for the end
years.
</p>
<p>As from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 3.5.0, when a time zone location is first found in a
session, its value is cached in object <code>.sys.timezone</code> in the
base environment.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>Sys.timezone</code> returns an OS-specific character string, possibly
<code>NA</code> or an empty string (which on some OSes means &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;UTC&#8288;</span>&rsquo;).
This will be a location such as <code>"Europe/London"</code> if one can be
ascertained.
</p>
<p>A time zone region may be known by several names: for example
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;"Europe/London"&#8288;</span>&rsquo; is also known as &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;GB&#8288;</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;GB-Eire&#8288;</span>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Europe/Belfast&#8288;</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Europe/Guernsey&#8288;</span>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Europe/Isle_of_Man&#8288;</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Europe/Jersey&#8288;</span>&rsquo;.  A few regions
are also known by a summary of their time zone,
e.g. &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;PST8PDT&#8288;</span>&rsquo; is an alias for
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;America/Los_Angeles&#8288;</span>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><code>OlsonNames</code> returns a character vector, see the examples for
typical cases.  It may have an attribute <code>"Version"</code>, something
like &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;"2017c"&#8288;</span>&rsquo;.
</p>


<h3>Time zone names</h3>

<p>Names <code>"UTC"</code> and its synonym <code>"GMT"</code> are accepted on all
platforms.
</p>
<p>Where OSes describe their valid time zones can be obscure.  The help
for the C function <code>tzset</code> can be helpful, but it can also be
inaccurate.  There is a cumbersome POSIX specification (listed under
environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span> at
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08</a>),
which is often at least partially supported, but there are other more
user-friendly ways to specify time zones.
</p>
<p>Almost all <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> platforms make use of a time-zone database originally
compiled by Arthur David Olson and now managed by IANA, in which the
preferred way to refer to a time zone is by a location (typically of a
city), e.g., <code>Europe/London</code>, <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>,
<code>Pacific/Easter</code> within a &lsquo;time zone region&rsquo;.  Some
traditional designations are also allowed such as <code>EST5EDT</code> or
<code>GB</code>.  (Beware that some of these designations may not be what
you expect: in particular <code>EST</code> is a time zone used in Canada
<em>without</em> daylight saving time, and not <code>EST5EDT</code> nor
(Australian) Eastern Standard Time.)  The designation can also be an
optional colon prepended to the path to a file giving complied zone
information (and the examples above are all files in a system-specific
location).  See <a href="http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm">http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm</a> for more
details and references.  By convention, regions with a unique
time-zone history since 1970 have specific names in the database, but
those with different earlier histories may not.  Each time zone has
one or two (the second for DST) <em>abbreviations</em> used when
formatting times.
</p>
<p>The abbreviations used have changed over the years: for example France
used &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;PMT&#8288;</span>&rsquo; (&lsquo;Paris Mean Time&rsquo;) from 1891 to 1911 then
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;WET/WEST&#8288;</span>&rsquo; up to 1940 and &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;CET/CEST&#8288;</span>&rsquo; from 1946.  (In almost
all time zones the abbreviations have been stable since 1970.)  The
POSIX standard allows only one or two abbreviations per time zone, so
you may see the current abbreviation(s) used for older times.
</p>
<p>For some time zones abbreviations are like &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;-03&#8288;</span>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;+0845&#8288;</span>&rsquo;: this is done when there is no official abbreviation.
(Negative values are behind (West of) UTC, as for the <code>"%z"</code>
format for <code>strftime</code>.)
</p>
<p>The function <code>OlsonNames</code> returns the time-zone names known to
the currently selected Olson/IANA database.  The system-specific
location in the file system varies,
e.g. &lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/share/zoneinfo</span>&rsquo; (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD),
&lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo</span>&rsquo; (Solaris, AIX), ....  It is likely
that there is a file named something like &lsquo;<span class="file">zone.tab</span>&rsquo; under that
directory listing the locations known as time-zone names (but not for
example <code>EST5EDT</code>).  See also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab</a>.
</p>
<p>Where <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> was configured with option <span class="option">--with-internal-tzcode</span>
(the default on macOS and Windows: recommended on Solaris), the database at
<code>file.path(R.home("share"), "zoneinfo")</code> is used by default: file
&lsquo;<span class="file">VERSION</span>&rsquo; in that directory states the version.  Environment
variable <span class="env">TZDIR</span> can be used to point to a different
&lsquo;<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>&rsquo; database: this is also supported by the native
services on some OSes, e.g. Linux using <code>glibc</code> except in
secure modes.

</p>
<p>Time zones given by name (<em>via</em> environment variable <span class="env">TZ</span>, in
<code>tz</code> arguments to functions such as <code>as.POSIXlt</code> and
perhaps the system time zone) are loaded from the currently selected
&lsquo;<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>&rsquo; database.
</p>
<p>Most platforms support time zones of the form &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Etc/GMT+n&#8288;</span>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Etc/GMT-n&#8288;</span>&rsquo; (possibly also without prefix &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Etc/&#8288;</span>&rsquo;), which
assume a fixed offset from UTC (hence no DST).  Contrary to some
expectations (but consistent with names such as &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;PST8PDT&#8288;</span>&rsquo;),
negative offsets are times ahead of (east of) UTC, positive offsets
are times behind (west of) UTC.
</p>
<p>Immediately prior to the advent of legislated time zones, most people
used time based on their longitude (or that of a nearby town), known
as &lsquo;Local Mean Time&rsquo; and abbreviated as &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;LMT&#8288;</span>&rsquo; in the
databases: in many countries that was codified with a specific name
before the switch to a standard time.  For example, Paris codified its
LMT as &lsquo;Paris Mean Time&rsquo; in 1891 (to be used throughout
mainland France) and switched to &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;GMT+0&#8288;</span>&rsquo; in 1911.
</p>

<p>Some systems (notably Linux) have a <code>tzselect</code> command which
allows the interactive selection of a supported time zone name.  On
systems using <code>systemd</code> (notably Linux), the OS command
<code>timedatectl list-timezones</code> will list all available time zone
names.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>There is a system-specific upper limit on the number of bytes in
(abbreviated) time-zone names which can be as low as 6 (as required by
POSIX).  Some OSes allow the setting of time zones with names which
exceed their limit, and that can crash the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session.
</p>
<p><code>OlsonNames</code> tries to find an Olson database in known locations.
It might not succeed (when it returns an empty vector with a warning)
and even if it does it might not locate the database used by the
date-time code linked into <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  Fortunately names are added rarely
and most databases are pretty complete.
</p>


<h3>How the system time zone is found</h3>

<p>This section is of background interest for users of a Unix-alike, but
may help if an <code>NA</code> value is returned unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Commercial Unixen such as Solaris and AIX set <span class="env">TZ</span>, so the value
when <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> is started is used.
</p>
<p>All other common platforms (Linux, macOS, *BSD) use similar schemes,
either derived from <code>tzcode</code> (currently distributed from
<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">https://www.iana.org/time-zones</a>) or independently coded
(<code>glibc</code>, <code>musl-libc</code>).  Such systems read the time-zone
information from a file &lsquo;<span class="file">localtime</span>&rsquo;, usually under &lsquo;<span class="file">/etc</span>&rsquo;
(but possibly under &lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/local/etc</span>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/local/etc/zoneinfo</span>&rsquo;).  As the usual Linux manual page for
<code>localtime</code> says
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because the time zone identifier is extracted from the symlink
target name of &lsquo;<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>&rsquo;, this file may not be a normal
file or hardlink.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some Linux distributions (including the one from which
that quote was taken) or sysadmins have chosen to copy a time-zone file
to &lsquo;<span class="file">localtime</span>&rsquo;.  For a non-symlink, the ultimate fallback is to
compare that file to all files in the time-zone database.
</p>
<p>Some Linux platforms provide two other mechanisms which are tried in
turn before looking at &lsquo;<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>&rsquo;.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>&lsquo;Modern&rsquo; Linux systems use <code>systemd</code> which
provides mechanisms to set and retrieve the time zone (amongst other
things).  There is a command <code>timedatectl</code> to give details.
(Unfortunately RHEL/Centos 6.x are not &lsquo;modern&rsquo;.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Debian-derived systems since <em>ca</em> 2007 have supplied a
file &lsquo;<span class="file">/etc/timezone</span>&rsquo;.  Its format is undocumented but it
empirically it contains a single line of text naming the time zone.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>In each case a sanity check is performed that the time-zone name is the
name of a file in the time-zone database.  (The systems probably use
the time-zone file (symlinked to) &lsquo;<span class="file">/etc/localtime</span>&rsquo;, but the
<code>Sys.timezone</code> code
does not check that is the same as the named file in the database.  This is deliberate
as they may be from different dates.)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Since 2007 there has been considerable disruption over changes to the
timings of the DST transitions, aimed at energy conservation.  These
often have short notice and time-zone databases may not be up to date.
(Morocco in 2013 announced a change to the end of DST at <em>a days</em>
notice, and in 2015 North Korea gave imprecise information about a
change a week in advance.)
</p>
<p>On platforms with case-insensitive file systems, time zone names will be
case-insensitive.  They may or may not be on other platforms and so,
for example, <code>"gmt"</code> is valid on some platforms and not on others.
</p>
<p>Note that except where replaced, the operation of time zones is an OS
service, and even where replaced a third-party database is used and
can be updated (see the section on &lsquo;Time zone names&rsquo;).
Incorrect results will never be an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> issue, so please ensure that you
have the courtesy not to blame <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> for them.
