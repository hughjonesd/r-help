<h2 id='setClass'>Create a Class Definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to create (<code>setClass</code>) and manipulate class definitions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>setClass(Class, representation, prototype, contains=character(),
         validity, access, where, version, sealed, package)

removeClass(Class, where)

isClass(Class, formal=TRUE, where)

getClasses(where, inherits = missing(where))

findClass(Class, where, unique = "")

resetClass(Class, classDef, where)

sealClass(Class, where)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_Class">Class</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string name for the class.  Other than
<code>setClass</code>, the functions will usually take a class definition
instead of the string (allowing the caller to identify the class uniquely).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_representation">representation</code></td>
<td>
<p> the slots that the new class should have
and/or other classes that this class extends.  Usually a call to
the <code>representation</code> function. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_prototype">prototype</code></td>
<td>
<p> an object (usually a list) providing the default
data for the slots specified in the representation. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_contains">contains</code></td>
<td>
<p> what classes does this class extend?  (These are
called <em>superclasses</em> in some languages.)  When these classes
have slots, all their slots will be contained in the new class as
well. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_where">where</code></td>
<td>
<p> For <code>setClass</code> and <code>removeClass</code>, the
environment in which to store or remove the
definition.  Defaults to the top-level environment of the calling function
(the global environment for ordinary computations, but the
environment or namespace of a package when loading that package).
</p>
<p>For other functions, <code>where</code> defines where to do the search
for the class definition, and the default is to search from the top-level
environment or namespace of the caller to this function.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_unique">unique</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>findClass</code> expects a unique location for the
class, <code>unique</code> is a character string explaining the purpose
of the search (and is used in warning and error messages).  By
default, multiple locations are possible and the function always
returns a list.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_inherits">inherits</code></td>
<td>
<p>in a call to <code>getClasses</code>, should the value
returned include all parent environments of <code>where</code>, or that
environment only?  Defaults to <code>TRUE</code> if <code>where</code> is
omitted, and to <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_validity">validity</code></td>
<td>
<p> if supplied, should be a validity-checking method
for objects from this class (a function that returns <code>TRUE</code> if
its argument is a valid object of this class and one or more strings
describing the failures otherwise).  See <code>validObject</code>
for details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_access">access</code></td>
<td>
<p>Access list for the class.  Saved in the definition, but
not currently used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_version">version</code></td>
<td>
<p>A version indicator for this definition. Saved in the
definition, but not currently used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_sealed">sealed</code></td>
<td>
<p> If <code>TRUE</code>, the class definition will be sealed,
so that another call to <code>setClass</code> will fail on this class name.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_package">package</code></td>
<td>
<p> An optional package name for the class.  By default
(and usually) the package where the class definition is assigned
will be used.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_formal">formal</code></td>
<td>
<p> Should a formal definition be required? </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_classDef">classDef</code></td>
<td>
<p> For <code>removeClass</code>, the optional class
definition (but usually it's better for <code>Class</code> to be the
class definition, and to omit <code>classDef</code>).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These are the functions that create and manipulate formal class
definitions.  Brief documentation is provided below.  See the
references for an introduction and for more details.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>setClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Define <code>Class</code> to be an S-style class.  The effect is to
create an object, of class <code>"classRepEnvironment"</code>, and store
this (hidden) in the specified environment or database.  Objects
can be created from the class (e.g., by calling
<code>new</code>), manipulated (e.g., by accessing the object's
slots), and methods may be defined including the class name in the
signature (see <code>setMethod</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>removeClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Remove the definition of this class, from the environment
<code>where</code> if this argument is supplied; if not,
<code>removeClass</code> will search for a definition, starting in the
top-level environment of the call to <code>removeClass</code>, and
remove the (first) definition found.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>isClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Is this the name of a formally defined class? (Argument
<code>formal</code> is for compatibility and is ignored.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>getClasses</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>The names of all the classes formally defined on <code>where</code>.  If
called with no argument, all the classes visible from the
calling function (if called from the top-level, all the classes
in any of the environments on the search list).  The
<code>inherits</code> argument can be used to search a particular
environment and all its parents, but usually the default setting
is what you want.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>findClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>The list of environments or positions on the search list in
which a class definition of <code>Class</code> is found.  If
<code>where</code> is supplied, this is an environment (or namespace)
from which the search takes place; otherwise the top-level
environment of the caller is used.  If <code>unique</code> is supplied
as a character string, <code>findClass</code> returns a single
environment or position.  By default, it always returns a list.
The calling function should select, say, the first element as a
position or environment for functions such as <code>get</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>unique</code> is supplied as a character string,
<code>findClass</code> will warn if there is more than one definition
visible (using the string to identify the purpose of the call),
and will generate an error if no definition can be found.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>resetClass</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>Reset the internal definition of a class.  Causes the complete
definition of the class to be re-computed, from the
representation and superclasses specified in the original
call to <code>setClass</code>.
</p>
<p>This function is called when aspects of the class definition are
changed.  You would need to call it explicitly if you changed the
definition of a class that this class extends (but doing that in
the  middle of a session is living dangerously, since it may
invalidate existing objects).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sealClass</code>:</dt><dd><p> Seal the current definition of the specified
class, to prevent further changes.  It is possible to seal a class
in the call to <code>setClass</code>, but sometimes further changes have
to be made (e.g., by calls to <code>setIs</code>).  If so, call
<code>sealClass</code> after all the relevant changes have been made.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Inheritance and Prototypes</h3>

<p>Defining new classes that inherit from (&ldquo;extend&rdquo;) other classes
is a powerful technique, but has to be used carefully and not
over-used.  Otherwise, you will often get unintended results when you
start to compute with objects from the new class.
</p>
<p>As shown in the examples below, the simplest and safest form of
inheritance is to start with an explicit class, with some slots, that
does not extend anything else.  It only does what we say it does.
</p>
<p>Then extensions will add some new slots and new behavior.
</p>
<p>Another variety of extension starts with one of the built-in data types,
perhaps with the intension of modifying R's standard behavior for that
class.  In this case, the new class inherits the built-in data type
as its &ldquo;data&rdquo; part.  See the &ldquo;numWithId&rdquo; example below.
</p>
<p>When such a class definition is printed, the data part shows up as a
pseudo-slot named &ldquo;.Data&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>S3 Classes</h3>

<p>Earlier, informal classes of objects (usually referred to as
&ldquo;S3&rdquo; classes) are used by many R functions.  It's natural to
consider including them as the class for a slot in a formal class,
or even as a class to be extended by the new class.  This isn't
prohibited but there are some disadvantages, and if you do want to
include S3 classes, they should be declared by including them in a
call to <code>setOldClass</code>.  Here are some considerations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Using S3 classes somewhat defeats the purpose of defining a
formal class:  An important advantage to your users is that a formal
class provides guarantees of what the object contains (minimally,
the classes of the slots and therfore what data they contain;
optionally, any other requirements imposed by a validity method).
</p>
<p>But there is no guarantee whatever about the data in an object from
an S3 class.  It's entirely up to the functions that create or
modify such objects.  If you want to provide guarantees to your
users, you will need a valdity method that explicitly checks the
contents of S3-class objects.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> To get the minimal guarantee (that the object in a slot has, or
extends, the class for the slot) you should ensure that the S3
classes are known to <em>be</em> S3 classes, with the possible
inheritance.  To do this, include a call to
<code>setOldClass</code> for the S3 classes used.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the S3 class is undefined (and the code used by
<code>setClass</code> will issue a warning).  Slot assignments, for
example, will not then check for possible errors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> These caveats apply to S3 classes; that is, objects with a
class assigned by some R function but without a formal class
definition.  In contrast, the built-in data types (<code>numeric</code>,
<code>list</code>, etc.) are generally fine as slots or for
<code>contains=</code> classes (see the previous section).  These data
types don't have formal slots, but the base code in the system
essentially forces them to contain the type of data they claim to
have.
</p>
<p>The data types <code>matrix</code> and <code>array</code> are somewhat in
between.  They do not have an explicit S3 class, but do have one or
two attributes.  There is no general problem in having these as
slots, but because there is no guarantee of a dimnames slot, they
don't work as formal classes.  The <code>ts</code> class is treated as a
formal class, extending class <code>vector</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>References</h3>

<p>The <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> package <span class="pkg">methods</span> implements, with a few exceptions, the
programming interface for classes and methods in the book
<em>Programming with Data</em> (John M. Chambers, Springer, 1998), in
particular sections 1.6, 2.7, 2.8, and chapters 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>While the programming interface for the <span class="pkg">methods</span> package follows
the reference, the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> software is an original implementation, so
details in the reference that reflect the S4 implementation may appear
differently in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  Also, there are extensions to the programming
interface developed more recently than the reference.  For a
discussion of details and ongoing development, see the web page
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/methodsPackage.html">http://developer.r-project.org/methodsPackage.html</a> and the
pointers from that page.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
## A simple class with two slots
setClass("track",
         representation(x="numeric", y="numeric"))
## A class extending the previous, adding one more slot
setClass("trackCurve",
         representation("track", smooth = "numeric"))
## A class similar to "trackCurve", but with different structure
## allowing matrices for the "y" and "smooth" slots
setClass("trackMultiCurve",
         representation(x="numeric", y="matrix", smooth="matrix"),
         prototype = list(x=numeric(), y=matrix(0,0,0),
                          smooth= matrix(0,0,0)))
##
## Suppose we want trackMultiCurve to be like trackCurve when there's
## only one column.
## First, the wrong way.
try(setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
    test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1}))

## Why didn't that work?  You can only override the slots "x", "y",
## and "smooth" if you provide an explicit coerce function to correct
## any inconsistencies:

setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
  test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1},
  coerce = function(obj) {
     new("trackCurve",
         x = slot(obj, "x"),
         y = as.numeric(slot(obj,"y")),
         smooth = as.numeric(slot(obj, "smooth")))
  })

## A class that extends the built-in data type "numeric"

setClass("numWithId", representation(id = "character"),
         contains = "numeric")

new("numWithId", 1:3, id = "An Example")
