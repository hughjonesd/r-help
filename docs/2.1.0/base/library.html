<h2 id='library'>Loading and Listing of Packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>library</code> and <code>require</code> load add-on packages.
</p>
<p><code>.First.lib</code> is called when a package is loaded;
<code>.Last.lib</code> is called when a package is detached.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>library(package, help, pos = 2, lib.loc = NULL,
        character.only = FALSE, logical.return = FALSE,
        warn.conflicts = TRUE,
        keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
        verbose = getOption("verbose"),
        version)

require(package, quietly = FALSE, warn.conflicts = TRUE,
        keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
        character.only = FALSE, version, save = TRUE)

.First.lib(libname, pkgname)
.Last.lib(libpath)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_package">package</code>, <code id="library_:_help">help</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a package, given as a name or
literal character string, or a character string, depending on
whether <code>character.only</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (default) or
<code>TRUE</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_pos">pos</code></td>
<td>
<p>the position on the search list at which to attach the
loaded package.  Note that <code>.First.lib</code> may attach other
packages, and <code>pos</code> is computed <em>after</em> <code>.First.lib</code>
has been run.  Can also be the name of a position on the current
search list as given by <code>search()</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_lib.loc">lib.loc</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector describing the location of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
library trees to search through, or <code>NULL</code>.  The default value
of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries currently known.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_character.only">character.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating whether <code>package</code> or
<code>help</code> can be assumed to be character strings.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_version">version</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string denoting a version number of the
package to be loaded, for use with <em>versioned installs</em>: see
the section later in this document.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_logical.return">logical.return</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  If it is <code>TRUE</code>,  <code>FALSE</code> or
<code>TRUE</code> is returned to indicate success.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_warn.conflicts">warn.conflicts</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, warnings are
printed about <code>conflicts</code> from attaching the new
package, unless that package contains an object <code>.conflicts.OK</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_keep.source">keep.source</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, functions &ldquo;keep their
source&rdquo; including comments, see argument <code>keep.source</code> to
<code>options</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_verbose">verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, additional diagnostics are
printed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_quietly">quietly</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, no message confirming
package loading is printed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="library_:_save">save</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical or environment.  If <code>TRUE</code>, a call to
<code>require</code> from the source for a package will save the name of
the required package in the variable <code>".required"</code>, allowing
function <code>detach</code> to warn if a required package is
detached. See section &lsquo;Packages that require other packages&rsquo; below.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>library(package)</code> and <code>require(package)</code> both load the
package with name <code>package</code>.  <code>require</code> is designed for use
inside other functions; it returns <code>FALSE</code> and gives a warning
(rather than an error as <code>library()</code> does) if the package does
not exist.  Both functions check and update the list of currently
loaded packages and do not reload code that is already loaded.
</p>
<p>For large packages, setting <code>keep.source = FALSE</code> may save quite
a bit of memory.
</p>
<p>If <code>library</code> is called with no <code>package</code> or <code>help</code>
argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified
by <code>lib.loc</code>, and returns the corresponding information in an
object of class <code>"libraryIQR"</code>.  The structure of this class may
change in future versions.  In earlier versions of R, only the names
of all available packages were returned; use <code>.packages(all =
    TRUE)</code> for obtaining these.  Note that
<code>installed.packages()</code>
returns even more information.
</p>
<p><code>library(help = somename)</code> computes basic information about the
package <code>somename</code>, and returns this in an object of class
<code>"packageInfo"</code>.  The structure of this class may change in
future versions.  When used with the default value (<code>NULL</code>) for
<code>lib.loc</code>, the loaded packages are searched before the libraries.
</p>
<p><code>.First.lib</code> is called when a package without a namespace is
loaded by <code>library</code>.  (For packages with namespaces see
<code>.onLoad</code>.)  It is called with two arguments, the name of
the library directory where the package was found (i.e., the
corresponding element of <code>lib.loc</code>), and the name of the package
(in that order).  It is a good place to put calls to
<code>library.dynam</code> which are needed when loading a package
into this function (don't call <code>library.dynam</code> directly, as this
will not work if the package is not installed in a &ldquo;standard&rdquo;
location).  <code>.First.lib</code> is invoked after the search path
interrogated by <code>search()</code> has been updated, so
<code>as.environment(match("package:name", search()))</code> will return the
environment in which the package is stored.  If calling
<code>.First.lib</code> gives an error the loading of the package is
abandoned, and the package will be unavailable.  Similarly, if the
option <code>".First.lib"</code> has a list element with the package's name,
this element is called in the same manner as <code>.First.lib</code> when
the package is loaded.  This mechanism allows the user to set package
&ldquo;load hooks&rdquo; in addition to startup code as provided by the
package maintainers, but <code>setHook</code> is preferred.
</p>
<p><code>.Last.lib</code> is called when a package is detached.  Beware
that it might be called if <code>.First.lib</code> has failed, so it
should be written defensively. (It is called within <code>try</code>,
so errors will not stop the package being detached.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>library</code> returns the list of loaded (or available) packages
(or <code>TRUE</code> if <code>logical.return</code> is <code>TRUE</code>).
<code>require</code> returns a logical indicating whether the required
package is available.
</p>


<h3>Packages that require other packages</h3>

<p>The source code for a
package that requires one or more other packages should have a call
to <code>require</code>, preferably near the beginning of the source, and
of course before any code that uses functions, classes or methods
from the other package.  The default for argument <code>save</code> will
save the names of all required packages in the environment of the
new package.  The saved package names are used by
<code>detach</code> when a package is detached to warn if other
packages still require the detached package.  Also, if a package is
installed with saved image (see INSTALL), the saved package
names are used to require these packages when the new package is
attached.
</p>


<h3>Formal methods</h3>

<p><code>library</code> takes some further actions when package <span class="pkg">methods</span>
is attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal generic
functions as well as re-defining functions in other packages (notably
<span class="pkg">base</span>) to be generic, and this information is cached whenever
such a package is loaded after <span class="pkg">methods</span> and re-defined functions
are excluded from the list of conflicts.  The check requires looking
for a pattern of objects; the pattern search may be avoided by
defining an object <code>.noGenerics</code>
(with any value) in the package.  Naturally, if the package
<em>does</em> have any such methods, this will prevent them from being used.
</p>


<h3>Versioned installs</h3>

<p>Packages can be installed with version information by <code>R CMD
    INSTALL --with-package-versions</code> or
<code>install.packages(installWithVers = TRUE)</code>.  This allows
more than one version of a package to be installed in a library
directory, using package directory names like <code>foo_1.5-1</code>.  When
such packages are loaded, it is this <em>versioned</em>  name
that <code>search()</code> returns.  Some utility functions require
the versioned name and some the unversioned name (here <code>foo</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>version</code> <em>is not</em> specified, <code>library</code> looks first
for a packages of that name, and then for versioned installs of the
package, selecting the one with the latest version number.  If
<code>version</code> <em>is</em> specified, a versioned install with an
exactly matching version is looked for.
</p>
<p>If <code>version</code> is not specified, <code>require</code> will accept any
version that is already loaded, whereas <code>library</code> will look for
an unversioned install even if a versioned install is already loaded.
</p>
<p>Loading more than one version of a package into an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> session is not
currently supported.  Support for versioned installs is patchy.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>library</code> and <code>require</code> can only load an <em>installed</em>
package, and this is detected by having a &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file
containing a <code>Built:</code> field.
</p>
<p>Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was installed
under a similar operating system as given by <code>R.version$platform</code>
(the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other OSes
because of potential problems with line endings and OS-specific help
files.
</p>
<p>As of version 2.0.0, the package name given to <code>library</code> and
<code>require</code> must match the name given in the package's
<code>DESCRIPTION</code> file exactly, even on case-insensitive file systems
such as MS Windows.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>library()                   # list all available packages

require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
detach(pos = match(paste("package", pkg, sep=":"), search()))

require(nonexistent)        # FALSE
## Not run: 
## Suppose a package needs to call a shared library named 'fooEXT',
## where 'EXT' is the system-specific extension.  Then you should use
.First.lib &lt;- function(lib, pkg) {
  library.dynam("foo", pkg, lib)
}

## if you want to mask as little as possible, use
library(mypkg, pos = "package:base")
