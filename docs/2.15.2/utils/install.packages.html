<h2 id='install.packages'>Install Packages from Repositories or Local Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from
local files.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>install.packages(pkgs, lib, repos = getOption("repos"),
                 contriburl = contrib.url(repos, type),
                 method, available = NULL, destdir = NULL,
                 dependencies = NA, type = getOption("pkgType"),
                 configure.args = getOption("configure.args"),
                 configure.vars = getOption("configure.vars"),
                 clean = FALSE, Ncpus = getOption("Ncpus", 1L),
                 libs_only = FALSE, INSTALL_opts, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_pkgs">pkgs</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of the names of packages whose
current versions should be downloaded from the repositories.
</p>
<p>If <code>repos = NULL</code>, a character vector of file paths of
&lsquo;<span class="file">.tar.gz</span>&rsquo; files.  These can be source archives or binary
package archive files (as created by <code>R CMD build --binary</code>).
On a CRAN build of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> for Mac OS X these can be &lsquo;<span class="file">.tgz</span>&rsquo; files
containing binary package archives.
Tilde-expansion will be done on the file paths.
</p>
<p>If this is missing or a zero-length character vector, a listbox of
available packages is presented where possible in an interactive <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
session.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_lib">lib</code></td>
<td>

<p>character vector giving the library directories where to
install the packages.  Recycled as needed.  If missing, defaults to
the first element of <code>.libPaths()</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_repos">repos</code></td>
<td>

<p>character vector, the base URLs of the repositories
to use, e.g., the URL of a CRAN mirror such as
<code>"http://cran.us.r-project.org"</code>.
</p>
<p>Can be <code>NULL</code> to install from local files
(with extension &lsquo;<span class="file">.tar.gz</span>&rsquo; for source packages).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_contriburl">contriburl</code></td>
<td>

<p>URL(s) of the contrib sections of the repositories.  Use this
argument only if your repository mirror is incomplete, e.g., because
you burned only the &lsquo;<span class="file">contrib</span>&rsquo; section on a CD.  Overrides
argument <code>repos</code>.  As with <code>repos</code>, can also be <code>NULL</code>
to install from local files.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_method">method</code></td>
<td>

<p>download method, see <code>download.file</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_available">available</code></td>
<td>

<p>an object as returned by <code>available.packages</code>
listing packages available at the repositories, or <code>NULL</code> when
the function makes an internal call to <code>available.packages</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_destdir">destdir</code></td>
<td>

<p>directory where downloaded packages are stored.  If it is
<code>NULL</code> (the default) a subdirectory
<code>downloaded_packages</code> of the session temporary
directory will be used (and the files will be deleted
at the end of the session). 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_dependencies">dependencies</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating to also install uninstalled
packages which these packages depend on/link to/import/suggest
(and so on recursively).  Not used if <code>repos = NULL</code>.
Can also be a character vector, a subset of
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")</code>.
</p>
<p>Only supported if <code>lib</code> is of length one (or missing),
so it is unambiguous where to install the dependent packages.  If
this is not the case it is ignored, with a warning.
</p>
<p>The default, <code>NA</code>, means
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code>.
</p>
<p><code>TRUE</code> means (as from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 2.15.0) to use
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")</code> for
<code>pkgs</code> and
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code> for added dependencies:
this installs all the packages needed to run <code>pkgs</code>, their
examples, tests and vignettes (if the package author specified them
correctly).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_type">type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, indicating the type of package to download and
install.
</p>
<p>Possible values are <code>"source"</code>, <code>"mac.binary.leopard"</code> and
<code>"win.binary"</code>: the binary types can be listed and downloaded
but not installed on other platforms.
</p>
<p>The default is the appropriate binary type on Windows and on
the CRAN binary Mac OS X distribution, otherwise <code>"source"</code>.
For the platforms where binary packages are the default, an
alternative is <code>"both"</code> which means &lsquo;try binary if
available, otherwise try source&rsquo;.  (This will only choose the
binary package if its version number is no older than the source
version.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_configure.args">configure.args</code></td>
<td>

<p>(not used on Windows) a character vector or a named list.  If a
character vector with no names is supplied, the elements are
concatenated into a single string (separated by a space) and used as
the value for the <span class="option">--configure-args</span> flag in the call to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.  If the character vector has names these
are assumed to identify values for <span class="option">--configure-args</span> for
individual packages.  This allows one to specify settings for an
entire collection of packages which will be used if any of those
packages are to be installed.  (These settings can therefore be
re-used and act as default settings.)
</p>
<p>A named list can be used also to the same effect, and that
allows multi-element character strings for each package
which are concatenated to a single string to be used as the
value for <span class="option">--configure-args</span>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_configure.vars">configure.vars</code></td>
<td>

<p>(not used on Windows) analogous to <code>configure.args</code> for flag
<span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, which is used to set environment variables
for the <code>configure</code> run. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_clean">clean</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether to specify
to add the <span class="option">--clean</span> flag to the call to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.
This is sometimes used to perform additional operations at the end
of the package installation in addition to removing intermediate files.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_Ncpus">Ncpus</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of parallel processes to use for a parallel
install of more than one source package.  Values greater than one
are supported if the <code>make</code> command specified by
<code>Sys.getenv("MAKE", "make")</code> accepts argument <code>-k -j
    <var>Ncpus</var></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_libs_only">libs_only</code></td>
<td>

<p>a logical value: should the <span class="option">--libs-only</span> option be used to
install only additional sub-architectures?  (See also
<code>INSTALL_opts</code>.)  This can also be used on Windows to install
just the DLL(s) from a binary package, e.g. to add 64-bit DLLs to a
32-bit install. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_INSTALL_opts">INSTALL_opts</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional character vector of additional option(s) to be passed to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code> for a source package install.  E.g.
<code>c("--html", "--no-multiarch")</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="install.packages_:_...">...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Arguments to be passed to <code>download.file</code> (e.g.
<code>quiet = TRUE</code>), or to the functions for binary installs on Mac
OS X and Windows (which accept an argument <code>"lock"</code>: see the
section on &lsquo;Locking&rsquo;).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> packages are primarily distributed as <em>source</em> packages, but
<em>binary</em> packages (a packaging up of the installed package) are
also supported, and the type most commonly used on Windows and from
the CRAN distribution for Mac OS X.  This function can install either
type where supported, either by downloading a file from a repository
or from a local file.  The default type is given by
<code>getOption("pkgType")</code>: this defaults to <code>"source"</code>
apart from under Windows or a CRAN binary distribution for Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>This is the main function to install packages.  It takes
a vector of names and a destination library, downloads the packages
from the repositories and installs them.  (If the library is omitted
it defaults to the first directory in <code>.libPaths()</code>, with a
message if there is more than one.)  If <code>lib</code> is omitted or is of
length one and is not a (group) writable directory, the code offers
to create a personal library tree (the first element of
<code>Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")</code>) and install there.
</p>
<p>For source packages from a repository an attempt is made to
install the packages in an order that respects their dependencies.
This does assume that all the entries in <code>lib</code> are on the default
library path for installs (set by <span class="env">R_LIBS</span>).
</p>
<p>You are advised to run <code>update.packages</code> before
<code>install.packages</code> to ensure that any already installed
dependencies have their latest versions.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> is supported for source installs and for
Windows binary installs.
</p>
<p>For binary installs, the function also checks for the availability of
a source package on the same repository, and reports if the source
package has a later version, or is available but no binary version
is.  This check can be suppressed by
</p>
<pre>
      options(install.packages.check.source = "no")
</pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>There are various options for locking: these differ between source and
binary installs.
</p>
<p>By default for a source install, the library directory is
&lsquo;locked&rsquo; by creating a directory &lsquo;<span class="file">00LOCK</span>&rsquo; within it.  This
has two purposes: it prevents any other process installing into that
library concurrently, and is used to store any previous version of the
package to restore on error.  A finer-grained locking is provided by
the option <span class="option">--pkglock</span> which creates a separate lock for each
package: this allows enough freedom for parallel
installation.  Per-package locking is the default when installing a
single package, and for multiple packages when <code>Ncpus &gt; 1L</code>.
Finally locking (and restoration on error) can be suppressed by
<span class="option">--no-lock</span>.

</p>
<p>For a Mac OS X or Windows binary install, no locking is done by
default.  Setting argument <code>lock</code> to <code>TRUE</code> (it defaults to
the value of <code>getOption("install.lock", FALSE)</code>) will use
per-directory locking as described for source installs: if the value
is <code>"pkglock"</code> per-package locking will be used.
</p>
<p>If package locking is used on Windows with <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> and
the installation fails, the package will be restored to its previous
state.
</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for the package installation to fail so badly
that the lock directory is not removed: this inhibits any further
installs to the library directory (or for <code>--pkglock</code>, of the
package) until the lock directory is removed manually.
</p>


<h3>Parallel installs</h3>

<p>Parallel installs are attempted if <code>pkgs</code> has length greater than
one and <code>Ncpus &gt; 1</code>.  It makes use of a parallel <code>make</code>,
so the <code>make</code> specified (default <code>make</code>) when <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> was
built must be capable of supporting <code>make -j <var>n</var></code>: GNU make
and <code>dmake</code> do, but FreeBSD and Solaris <code>make</code> do not:
if necessary environment variable <span class="env">MAKE</span> can be set for the
current session to select a suitable <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p><code>install.packages</code> needs to be able to compute all the
dependencies of <code>pkgs</code> from <code>available</code>, including if one
element of <code>pkgs</code> depends indirectly on another.  This means that
if for example you are installing <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr> packages which depend
on Bioconductor packages which in turn depend on <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr>
packages, <code>available</code> needs to cover both <abbr><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></abbr> and
Bioconductor packages.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some binary distributions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> have <code>INSTALL</code> in a separate
bundle, e.g. an <code>R-devel</code> RPM.  <code>install.packages</code> will
give an error if called with <code>type = "source"</code> on such a system.
</p>
<p>Some binary distributions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> can be installed on a machine without the
tools needed to install packages: the remedy is to do a complete
install of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> which should bring in all those tools as dependencies.
