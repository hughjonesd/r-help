<h2 id='Memory-limits'>Memory Limits in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> holds objects it is using in memory.  This help file documents the
current design limitations on large objects: these differ between
32-bit and 64-bit builds of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> holds all objects in memory, and there are limits based on the
amount of memory that can be used by all objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> There may be limits on the size of the heap and the number of
cons cells allowed &ndash; see <code>Memory</code> &ndash; but these are
usually not imposed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is a limit on the address space of a single process such
as the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> executable.  This is system-specific, but 32-bit OSes
imposes a limit of no more than 4Gb: it is often 3Gb or less.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The environment may impose limitations on the resources
available to a single process &ndash; see the OS/shell's help on commands such
as <code>limit</code> or <code>ulimit</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Error messages beginning <code>cannot allocate vector of size</code>
indicate a failure to obtain memory, either because the size exceeded
the address-space limit for a process or, more likely, because the
system was unable to provide the memory.  Note that on a 32-bit OS
there may well be enough free memory available, but not a large enough
contiguous block of address space into which to map it.
</p>
<p>There are also limits on individual objects.  On all versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>,
the maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is
<code class="reqn">2^{31} - 1 \approx 2\thinspace 10^9</code>, as
lengths are stored as signed integers.  In addition, the storage space
cannot exceed the address limit, and if you try to exceed that limit,
the error message begins <code>cannot allocate vector of length</code>.
The number of characters in a character string is in theory only
limited by the address space.
</p>
