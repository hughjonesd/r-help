<h2 id='windows'>Windows graphics devices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A graphics device is opened. For <code>windows</code>, <code>win.graph</code>,
<code>x11</code> and <code>X11</code> this is a graphics window on the current
Windows display: the multiple names are for compatibility with other
systems.  <code>win.metafile</code> prints to a file and <code>win.print</code> to
the Windows print system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>windows(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12,
        record = getOption("graphics.record"),
        rescale = c("R", "fit", "fixed"), xpinch, ypinch,
        bg = "transparent", canvas = "white",
        gamma = getOption("gamma"), xpos = NA, ypos = NA,
        buffered = getOption("windowsBuffered"),
        restoreConsole = FALSE)

win.graph(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12,
          restoreConsole = FALSE)
x11(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12, restoreConsole = FALSE)
X11(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12, restoreConsole = FALSE)

win.metafile(filename = "", width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12,
             restoreConsole = TRUE)

win.print(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12, printer = "",
          restoreConsole = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_width">width</code>, <code id="windows_:_height">height</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (nominal) width and height of the canvas of
the plotting window in inches.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_pointsize">pointsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>the default pointsize of plotted text. Values are 
rounded to the nearest integer: values less than or equal to zero
are reset to 12.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_record">record</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: sets the initial state of the flag for
recording plots.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_rescale">rescale</code></td>
<td>
<p>controls the action for resizing plots.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_xpinch">xpinch</code>, <code id="windows_:_ypinch">ypinch</code></td>
<td>
<p>double.  Pixels per inch, horizontally and
vertically.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_bg">bg</code></td>
<td>
<p>color.  The default background color.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_canvas">canvas</code></td>
<td>
<p>color.  The color of the canvas which is visible
when the background color is transparent.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>the gamma correction factor.  This value is used
to ensure that the colors perceived are linearly related to
RGB values (see <code>hsv</code>).  By default this is taken from
<code>options("gamma")</code>, or is 1 (no correction) if that is
unset (the usual case).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_xpos">xpos</code>, <code id="windows_:_ypos">ypos</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer.  Position of the top left of the window, in
pixels.  Negative values are taken from the opposite edge of the
monitor.  Missing values meant take the default from the
&lsquo;<span class="file">Rconsole</span>&rsquo; file, which in turn defaults to
<code>xpos=-25, ypos=0</code>: this puts the right edge of the window 25
pixels from the right edge of the monitor.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_buffered">buffered</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  Should the screen output be double-buffered?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_filename">filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the output file: it will be an enhanced
Windows metafile, usually given extension <code>.emf</code> or
<code>.wmf</code>. Up to 511 characters are allowed.
The page number is substituted if an integer format is included
in the character string. (The result must be less than 600
characters long.)  The default, <code>""</code>, means the clipboard.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_printer">printer</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of a printer as known to Windows. The default
causes a dialog box to come for the user to choose a printer.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_restoreConsole">restoreConsole</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  see the Details below.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All these devices are implemented as <code>windows</code> devices, the
<code>display</code> parameter selects which is actually used.
</p>
<p>The size of a window is computed from information provided about the
display: it depends on the system being configured accurately.
By default a screen device asks Windows for the number of pixels per
inch.  This can be overridden (it is often wrong) by specifying
<code>xpinch</code> and <code>ypinch</code> or the corresponding options
<code>"xpinch"</code> and <code>"ypinch"</code>.
</p>
<p>A graphics window is not allowed to be specified at more that 85% of
the screen width or height: the width and height are rescaled
proportionally. The window can be resized to a larger size.  In MDI mode,
the limit is 85% of the MDI client region.
</p>
<p>If the <code>filename</code> is omitted for a <code>win.metafile</code> device, the
output is copied to the clipboard when the device is closed.
</p>
<p>If a screen device is re-sized, the default behaviour is to redraw the
plot(s) as if the new size had been specified originally.  Using
<code>"fit"</code> will rescale the existing plot(s) to fit the new device
region, preserving the aspect ratio.  Using <code>"fixed"</code> will leave
the plot size unchanged, adding scrollbars if part of the
plot is obscured.
</p>
<p>A graphics window will never be created at more that 85% of
the screen width or height, but can be resized to a larger size.
For the first two <code>rescale</code> options the width and height are
rescaled proportionally if necessary, and if <code>rescale = "fit"</code>
the plot(s) are rescaled accordingly.  If <code>rescale = "fixed"</code>
the initially displayed portion is selected within these constraints,
separately for width and height.
</p>
<p>Using <code>strwidth</code> or <code>strheight</code> after a window
has been rescaled (when using <code>"fit"</code>) gives dimensions in the
original units, but only approximately as they are derived from the
metrics of the rescaled fonts (which are in integer sizes)
</p>
<p>The displayed region may be bigger than the &lsquo;paper&rsquo; size, and
areas outside the &lsquo;paper&rsquo; are coloured in the Windows
application background colour.  Graphics parameters such as
<code>"din"</code> refer to the scaled plot if rescaling is in effect.
</p>
<p>The different colours need to be distinguished carefully. The area
outside the device region is coloured in the Windows application background
colour.  The device region is coloured in the canvas colour.  This is
over-painted by the background colour of a plot when a new page is
called for, but that background colour can be transparent (and is by
default).  The difference between setting the canvas colour and the
background colour is that when the device is copied the background
colour is copied but the canvas colour is not.
</p>
<p>Recorded plot histories are of class <code>"SavedPlots"</code>.  They have a
<code>print</code> method, and a subset method.  As the individual plots are
of class <code>"recordedplot"</code> they can be replayed by printing them:
see <code>recordPlot</code>.  The active plot history is stored in
variable <code>.SavedPlots</code> in the workspace.
</p>
<p>When a screen device is double-buffered (the default) the
screen is updated 100ms after last plotting call or every 500ms during
continuous plotting.  These times can be altered by setting
<code>options("windowsTimeout")</code> to a vector of two integers before
opening the device.
</p>
<p>The font used for text drawn in a Windows device may be controlled in
two ways.  The file <code>RHOME\etc\Rdevga</code> can be used to specify
mappings for <code>par(font=)</code> (in the graphics package).  Alternatively,
a device-independent <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> graphics font family can be specified (e.g.,
via <code>par(family=)</code> in the graphics package) and this will be
mapped via the Windows font database (see <code>windowsFonts</code>).
</p>
<p>Line widths as controlled by <code>par(lwd=)</code> are in multiples of
1/96inch.  Multiples less than 1 are allowed, down to one pixel width.
</p>
<p><code>pch="."</code> with <code>cex = 1</code> corresponds to a rectangle of sides
the larger of one pixel and 0.01 inch.
</p>
<p>For <code>win.metafile</code> only one plot is allowed per file, and Windows
seems to disallow reusing the file.  So the <em>only</em> way to allow
multiple plots is to use a parametrized <code>filename</code> as in the example.
</p>
<p>The <code>restoreConsole</code> argument is a temporary fix for a problem
in the current implementation of several Windows graphics devices,
and is likely to be removed in an upcoming release.  If set to
<code>FALSE</code>, the console will not receive the focus after the new
device is opened.  
</p>
