<h2 id='setClass'>Create a Class Definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create  a class definition, specifying the representation (the slots) and/or the classes contained in this one (the superclasses), plus other optional details.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>setClass(Class, representation, prototype, contains=character(),
         validity, access, where, version, sealed, package,
         S3methods = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_Class">Class</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string name for the class.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_representation">representation</code></td>
<td>
<p> a named list of the slots that the new class should have, the names giving the names of the slots and the corresponding elements being the character string names of  the corresponding classes.
Usually a call to
the <code>representation</code> function.
</p>
<p>Backward compatibility and compatibility with S-Plus allows unnamed
elements for superclasses, but the recommended style is to use the
<code>contains=</code> argument instead.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_prototype">prototype</code></td>
<td>
<p> an object providing the default
data for the slots in this class.  Usually and preferably the
result of a call to <code>prototype</code>. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_contains">contains</code></td>
<td>
<p> what classes does this class extend?  (These are
called <em>superclasses</em> in some languages.)  When these classes
have slots, all their slots will be contained in the new class as
well. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_where">where</code></td>
<td>
<p> the
environment in which to store or remove the
definition.  Defaults to the top-level environment of the calling function
(the global environment for ordinary computations, and the
environment or name space of a package in the source code for that package).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_validity">validity</code></td>
<td>
<p> if supplied, should be a validity-checking method
for objects from this class (a function that returns <code>TRUE</code> if
its argument is a valid object of this class and one or more strings
describing the failures otherwise).  See <code>validObject</code>
for details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_access">access</code>, <code id="setClass_:_version">version</code></td>
<td>
<p>access and version, included for
compatibility with S-Plus, but currently ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_sealed">sealed</code></td>
<td>
<p> if <code>TRUE</code>, the class definition will be sealed,
so that another call to <code>setClass</code> will fail on this class name.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_package">package</code></td>
<td>
<p> an optional package name for the class.  By default
(and usually) the name of the package in which the class definition is assigned.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="setClass_:_S3methods">S3methods</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, S3 methods may be written for this
class.  S3 generic functions and primitives will
dispatch an S3 method defined for this class, given an S4 object
from the class or from a subclass of it, provided no S4
method and no more
direct S3 method is found.  Writing S3 methods for S4 classes is
somewhat deprecated (see Methods), but if you do write
them, the class should be created with this argument
<code>TRUE</code>, so inheritance will work.  By default, the current
implementation takes no special action, so that methods will be
dispatched for this class but <em>not</em> for subclasses.  Note
that future versions may revoke this and dispatch no S3 methods
other than the default unless <code>S3methods</code> is <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Basic Use: Slots and Inheritance</h3>

<p>The two essential arguments, other than the class name are
<code>representation</code> and <code>contains</code>, defining the explicit slots
and the inheritance (superclasses). Together, these arguments define
all the information in an object from this class; that is, the names
of all the slots and the classes required for each of them.
</p>
<p>The name of the class determines
which methods apply directly to objects from this class.  The
inheritance information specifies which methods apply indirectly,
through inheritance.  See Methods.
</p>
<p>The slots in a class definition will be the union of all the slots
specified directly by <code>representation</code> and all the slots in all
the contained classes.
There can only be one slot with a given name; specifically, the
direct and inherited slot names must be unique.
That does not, however, prevent the same class from being inherited
via more than one path.
</p>
<p>One kind of element in the <code>contains=</code> argument is special, specifying one of the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
object types or one of a few other special <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> types (<code>matrix</code> and
<code>array</code>).
See the section on inheriting from object types, below.
</p>
<p>Slot name <code>"class"</code> is not allowed in the current implementation but
reserved. <code>"Class"</code> is valid, but undesirable, as it cannot be
used in <code>new(&lt;cl&gt;, Class = &lt;slot-value&gt;)</code> (because of
argument name matching).
There are other slot names with a special meaning; these names start with
the <code>"."</code> character.  To be safe, you should define all of
your own slots with names starting with an alphabetic character.
</p>


<h3>Inheriting from Object Types</h3>

<p>In addition to containing other S4 classes, a class definition can
contain either an S3 class (see the next section) or a built-in R pseudo-class&mdash;one
of the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
object types or one of the special <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> pseudo-classes <code>"matrix"</code> and
<code>"array"</code>.
A class can contain at most one of the object types, directly or indirectly.
When it does, that contained class determines the &ldquo;data part&rdquo;
of the class.
</p>
<p>Objects from the new class try to inherit the built in
behavior of the contained type.
In the case of normal <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> data types, including vectors, functions and
expressions, the implementation is relatively straightforward.
For any object <code>x</code> from the class,
<code>typeof(x)</code> will be the contained basic type; and a special
pseudo-slot, <code>.Data</code>, will be shown with the corresponding class.
See the <code>"numWithId"</code> example below.
</p>
<p>For an object from any class that does <em>not</em> contain such a type,
<code>typeof(x)</code> will be <code>"S4"</code>.
</p>
<p>Some <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> data types do not behave normally, in the sense that they are
non-local references or other objects that are not duplicated.
Examples include those corresponding to classes <code>"environment"</code>, <code>"externalptr"</code>, and <code>"name"</code>.
These can not be the types for objects with user-defined
classes (either S4 or S3) because setting an attribute overwrites the
object in all contexts.
It is possible to define a class that inherits from such types,
through an indirect mechanism that stores the inherited object in a
reserved slot.
The implementation tries to make such classes behave as if the object
had a data part of the corresponding object type.
Methods defined with the object type in the signature should work as
should core code that coerces an object to the type in an internal or
primitive calculation.
There is no guarantee, however, because C-level code may switch
directly on the object type, which in this case will be <code>"S4"</code>.
The cautious mechanism is to use <code>as(x, "environment")</code> or
something similar before doing the low-level computation.  See the
example for class <code>"stampedEnv"</code> below.
</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the object passed to the low-level computation
will be the underlying object type, <em>without</em> any of the slots
defined in the class.
To return the full information, you will usually have to define a
method that sets the data part.
</p>
<p>Note that, in the current implementation, the interpretation of the
<code>".Data"</code> pseudo-slot includes all of the object types above, as
well as the special pseudo-classes <code>"matrix"</code> and
<code>"array"</code>, which <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> treats internally as if they were object types
(they have no explicit class and <code>is.object</code> returns
<code>FALSE</code> for such objects).
Some of this implementation is still experimental, so a wise policy is
to use standard tools, such as <code>as(object, type)</code>, to convert to
the underlying data type, rather than the pseudo-slot, when possible.
</p>


<h3>Inheriting from S3 Classes</h3>

<p>Old-style S3 classes have no formal definition.  Objects are
&ldquo;from&rdquo; the class when their class attribute contains the
character string considered to be the class name.
</p>
<p>Using such classes with formal classes and methods is necessarily a
risky business, since there are no guarantees about the content of the
objects or about consistency of inherited methods.
Given that, it is still possible to define a class that inherits from
an S3 class, providing that class has been registered as an old class
(see <code>setOldClass</code>).
The essential result is that S3 method dispatch will use the S3 class
as registered when dispatching.
</p>
<p>Some additional options are planned, to control whether the object is
converted to an S3 class before dispatch.  In the present
implementation, it is not, which causes some S3 computations to
misbehave, since they are not seeing the S3 class explicitly.
</p>


<h3>Classes and Packages</h3>

<p>Class definitions normally belong to packages (but can be defined in
the  global environment as well, by evaluating the expression on the
command line or in a file sourced from the command line).
The corresponding package name is part of the class definition; that
is, part of the <code>classRepresentation</code> object holding that
definition.  Thus, two classes with the same name can exist in
different packages, for most purposes.
</p>
<p>When a class name is supplied for a slot or a superclass, a
corresponding class definition will be found, looking from the
name space or environment of the current package, assuming the call to
<code>setClass</code> in question appears directly in the source for the
package.  That's where it should appear, to avoid ambiguity.
</p>
<p>In particular, if the current package has a name space then the  class
must be found in the current package itself, in the imports defined by that
name space, or in the base package.
</p>
<p>When this rule does not identify a class uniquely (because it appears
in more than one imported package) then the <code>packageSlot</code>
of the character string name needs to be supplied with the name.
This should be a rare occurrence.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
## A simple class with two slots
setClass("track",
         representation(x="numeric", y="numeric"))
## A class extending the previous, adding one more slot
setClass("trackCurve",
    representation(smooth = "numeric"),
    contains = "track")
## A class similar to "trackCurve", but with different structure
## allowing matrices for the "y" and "smooth" slots
setClass("trackMultiCurve",
         representation(x="numeric", y="matrix", smooth="matrix"),
         prototype = list(x=numeric(), y=matrix(0,0,0),
                          smooth= matrix(0,0,0)))
##
## Suppose we want trackMultiCurve to be like trackCurve when there's
## only one column.
## First, the wrong way.
try(setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
    test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1}))

## Why didn't that work?  You can only override the slots "x", "y",
## and "smooth" if you provide an explicit coerce function to correct
## any inconsistencies:

setIs("trackMultiCurve", "trackCurve",
  test = function(obj) {ncol(slot(obj, "y")) == 1},
  coerce = function(obj) {
     new("trackCurve",
         x = slot(obj, "x"),
         y = as.numeric(slot(obj,"y")),
         smooth = as.numeric(slot(obj, "smooth")))
  })

## A class that extends the built-in data type "numeric"

setClass("numWithId", representation(id = "character"),
         contains = "numeric")

new("numWithId", 1:3, id = "An Example")

## inherit from reference object of type "environment"
setClass("stampedEnv", contains = "environment",
      representation(update = "POSIXct"))

e1 &lt;- new("stampedEnv",  update = Sys.time())

setMethod("[[&lt;-", c("stampedEnv", "character", "missing"),
   function(x, i, j, ..., value) {
