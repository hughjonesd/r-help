<h2 id='windows'>Windows graphics devices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A graphics device is opened. For <code>win.graph</code>, <code>windows</code>,
<code>x11</code> and <code>X11</code> this is a graphics window on the current
Windows display: the multiple names are for compatibility with other
systems. <code>win.metafile</code> prints to a file and <code>win.print</code> to
the Windows print system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>windows(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12,
        record = getOption("graphics.record"),
        rescale = c("R", "fit", "fixed"), xpinch, ypinch,
        canvas = "white", gamma = getOption("gamma"))
win.graph(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12)
x11(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12)
X11(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12)
win.metafile(filename = "", width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12)
win.print(width = 7, height = 7, pointsize = 12, printer = "")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_display">display</code></td>
<td>
<p>indicates the purpose of the device.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_filename">filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the output file: it will be an enhanced
Windows metafile, usually given extension <code>.emf</code> or <code>.wmf</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_width">width</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (nominal) width of the plotting window in inches.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_height">height</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (nominal) height of the plotting window in inches.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_pointsize">pointsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>the default pointsize of plotted text.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_record">record</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: sets the initial state of the flag for
recording plots.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_rescale">rescale</code></td>
<td>
<p>controls the action for resizing plots.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_xpinch">xpinch</code>, <code id="windows_:_ypinch">ypinch</code></td>
<td>
<p>double.  Pixels per inch, horizontally and
vertically.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_canvas">canvas</code></td>
<td>
<p>color.  The color of the canvas which is visible
when the background color is transparent.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>the gamma correction factor.  This value is used
to ensure that the colors displayed are linearly related to
RGB values. By default this is taken from
<code>options("gamma"</code>, or is 1 (no correction) if that is
unset.  It sets <code>par("gamma")</code> for the device.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="windows_:_printer">printer</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of a printer as known to Windows. The default
causes a dialog box to come for the user to choose a printer.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All these devices are implemented as <code>windows</code> devices, the
<code>display</code> parameter selects which is actually used.
</p>
<p>The size of a window is computed from information provided about the
display: it depends on the system being configured accurately.
By default a screen device asks Windows for the number of pixels per
inch.  This can be overridden (it is often wrong) by specifying
<code>xpinch</code> and <code>ypinch</code> or the corresponding options
<code>"xpinch"</code> and <code>"ypinch"</code>.
</p>
<p>A graphics window is not allowed to be specified at more that 85% of
the screen width or height: the width and height are rescaled
proportionally. The window can be resized to a larger size.
</p>
<p>If the <code>filename</code> is omitted for a <code>win.metafile</code> device, the
output is copied to the clipboard when the device is closed. A
<code>win.metafile</code> device can only be used for a single page.
</p>
<p>If a screen device is re-sized, the default behaviour is to redraw the
plot(s) as if the new size had been specified originally.  Using
<code>"fit"</code> will rescale the existing plot(s) to fit the new device
region, preserving the aspect ratio.  Using <code>"fixed"</code> will leave
the plot size unchanged, adding scrollbars if part of the
plot is obscured.
</p>
<p>A graphics window will never be created at more that 85% of
the screen width or height, but can be resized to a larger size.
For the first two <code>rescale</code> options the width and height are
rescaled proportionally if necessary, and if <code>rescale = "fit"</code>
the plot(s) are rescaled accordingly.  If <code>rescale = "fixed"</code>
the initially displayed portion is selected within these constraints,
separately for width and height.
</p>
<p>Using <code>strwidth</code> or <code>strheight</code> after a window
has been rescaled (when using <code>"fit"</code>) gives dimensions in the
original units, but only approximately as they are derived from the
metrics of the rescaled fonts (which are in integer sizes)
</p>
<p>The displayed region may be bigger than the &lsquo;paper&rsquo; size, and areas
outside the &lsquo;paper&rsquo; are coloured in the Windows application background
colour.  Graphics parameters such
as <code>"din"</code> refer to the scaled plot if rescaling is in effect.
</p>
<p>The different colours need to be distinguished carefully. The area
outside the device region is coloured in the Windows application background
colour.  The device region is coloured in the canvas colour.  This is
over-painted by the background colour of a plot when a new page is
called for, but that background colour can be transparent (and is by
default).  The difference between setting the canvas colour and the
background colour is that when the device is copied the background
colour is copied but the canvas colour is not.
</p>
<p>Recorded plot histories are of class <code>"SavedPlots"</code>.  They have a
<code>print</code> method, and a subset method.  As the individual plots are
of class <code>"recordedplot"</code> they can be replayed by printing them:
see <code>recordPlot</code>.  The active plot history is stored in
variable <code>.SavedPlots</code> in package <code>base</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>
