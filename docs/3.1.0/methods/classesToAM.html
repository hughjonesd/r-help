Compute an Adjacency Matrix for Superclasses of Class Definitions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a vector of class names or a list of class definitions, the
function returns an adjacency matrix of the superclasses of these
classes; that is, a matrix with class names as the row and column
names and with element [i, j] being 1 if the class in column j is a
direct superclass of the class in row i, and 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>The matrix has the information implied by the <code>contains</code> slot of
the class definitions, but in a form that is often more convenient for
further analysis; for example, an adjacency matrix is used in packages
and other software to construct graph representations of relationships.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>classesToAM(classes, includeSubclasses = FALSE,
       abbreviate = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="classesToAM_:_classes">classes</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either a character vector of class names or a list, whose
elements can be either class names or class definitions.  The
list is convenient, for example, to include the package slot for
the class name. See the examples.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="classesToAM_:_includeSubclasses">includeSubclasses</code></td>
<td>

<p>A logical flag; if <code>TRUE</code>, then the matrix will include all
the known subclasses of the specified classes as well as the
superclasses.  The argument can also be a logical vector of the
same length as <code>classes</code>, to include subclasses for some
but not all the classes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="classesToAM_:_abbreviate">abbreviate</code></td>
<td>

<p>Control of the abbreviation of the row and/or  column labels of
the matrix returned: values 0, 1, 2, or 3 abbreviate neither,
rows, columns or both.  The default, 2, is useful for printing
the matrix, since class names tend to be more than one
character long, making for spread-out printing.  Values of 0
or 3 would be appropriate for making a graph (3 avoids the
tendency of some graph plotting software to produce labels in
minuscule font size).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each of the classes, the calculation gets all the superclass
names from the class definition, and finds the edges in those classes'
definitions; that is, all the superclasses at distance 1.  The
corresponding elements of the adjacency matrix are set to 1.
</p>
<p>The adjacency matrices for the individual class definitions are
merged.  Note two possible kinds of inconsistency, neither of which
should cause problems except possibly with identically named classes from
different packages.  Edges are computed from each superclass
definition, so that information overrides a possible inference from
extension elements with distance &gt; 1 (and it should).  When
matrices from successive classes in the argument are merged, the
computations do not currently check for inconsistencies&mdash;this is
the area where possible multiple classes with the same name could
cause confusion.  A later revision may include consistency checks.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>As described, a matrix with entries 0 or 1, non-zero values
indicating that the class corresponding to the column is a direct
superclass of the class corresponding to the row.  The row and
column names are the class names (without package slot).
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>extends</code> and classRepresentation for the underlying information from the class
definition.
