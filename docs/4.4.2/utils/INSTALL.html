<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This will stop at the first error, so if you want all the <code>pkgs</code>
to be tried, call this via a shell loop.
</p>
<p>If used as <code>R CMD INSTALL pkgs</code> without explicitly specifying
<code>lib</code>, packages are installed into the library tree rooted at the
first directory in the library path which would be used by <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> run in
the current environment.
</p>
<p>To install into the library tree <code><var>lib</var></code>, use
<code>R CMD INSTALL -l <var>lib</var> <var>pkgs</var></code>.
This prepends <code>lib</code> to the library path for
duration of the install, so required packages in the installation
directory will be found (and used in preference to those in other
libraries).
</p>
<p>Both <code>lib</code> and the elements of <code>pkgs</code> may be absolute or
relative path names of directories.  <code>pkgs</code> may also contain
names of package archive files: these are then extracted to a
temporary directory.  These are tarballs containing a single
directory, optionally compressed by <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>,
<code>xz</code> or <code>compress</code>.
Finally, binary package archive files (as created by
<code>R CMD INSTALL --build</code>) can be supplied.
</p>
<p>Tarballs are by default unpackaged by the internal <code>untar</code>
function: if needed an external <code>tar</code> command can be specified
by the environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span>: please ensure that it
can handle the type of compression used on the tarball.  (This is
sometimes needed for tarballs containing invalid or unsupported
sections, and can be faster on very large tarballs.   Setting
<span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span> to &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;tar.exe&#8288;</span>&rsquo; has been needed to overcome
permissions issues on some Windows systems.)
</p>
<p>The package sources can be cleaned up prior to installation by
<span class="option">--preclean</span> or after by <span class="option">--clean</span>: cleaning is
essential if the sources are to be used with more than one
architecture or platform.
</p>
<p>Some package sources contain a &lsquo;<span class="file">configure</span>&rsquo; script that can be
passed arguments or variables via the option <span class="option">--configure-args</span>
and <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, respectively, if necessary.  The latter
is useful in particular if libraries or header files needed for the
package are in non-system directories.  In this case, one can use the
configure variables <code>LIBS</code> and <code>CPPFLAGS</code> to specify these
locations (and set these via <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>), see section
&lsquo;Configuration variables&rsquo; in
&lsquo;R Installation and Administration&rsquo; for more information.
(If these are used more than
once on the command line they are concatenated.)  The configure
mechanism can be bypassed using the option <span class="option">--no-configure</span>.
</p>
<p>If the attempt to install the package fails, leftovers are removed.
If the package was already installed, the old version is restored.
This happens either if a command encounters an error or if the
install is interrupted from the keyboard: after cleaning up the script
terminates.
</p>
<p>For details of the locking which is done, see the section
&lsquo;Locking&rsquo; in the help for <code>install.packages</code>.
</p>
<p>Option <span class="option">--build</span> can be used to tar up the installed package
for distribution as a binary package (as used on macOS).  This is done
by <code>utils::tar</code> unless environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span>
is set.
</p>
<p>By default a package is installed with static HTML help pages if and
only if <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> was: use options <span class="option">--html</span> and <span class="option">--no-html</span> to
override this.
</p>
<p>Packages are not by default installed keeping the source formatting
(see the <code>keep.source</code> argument to <code>source</code>): this
can be enabled by the option <span class="option">--with-keep.source</span> or by setting
environment variable <span class="env">R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE</span> to <code>yes</code>.
</p>
<p>Specifying the <span class="option">--install-tests</span> option copies the contents
of the &lsquo;<span class="file">tests</span>&rsquo; directory into the package installation. If the
<span class="env">R_ALWAYS_INSTALL_TESTS</span> environment variable is set to a true
value, the tests will be installed even if <span class="option">--install-tests</span> is
omitted.
</p>
<p>Use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code> for concise usage information,
including all the available options.
</p>


<h3>Sub-architectures</h3>

<p>An <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> installation can support more than one sub-architecture:
currently this is most commonly used for 32- and 64-bit builds on
Windows.
</p>
<p>For such installations, the default behaviour is to try to install
source packages for all installed sub-architectures unless the package
has a configure script or a &lsquo;<span class="file">src/Makefile</span>&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;<span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span>&rsquo; on Windows), when only compiled code for the
sub-architecture running <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> is installed.
</p>
<p>To install a source package with compiled code only for the
sub-architecture used by <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>, use
<span class="option">--no-multiarch</span>.  To install just the compiled code for
another sub-architecture, use <span class="option">--libs-only</span>.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to install for all available sub-architectures.  If
the configure script is known to work for both Windows architectures,
use flag <span class="option">--force-biarch</span> (and packages can specify this
<em>via</em> a &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Biarch: yes&#8288;</span>&rsquo; field in their <code>DESCRIPTION</code> files).
Second, a single tarball can be installed with
</p>
<pre>R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch mypkg_version.tar.gz</pre>


<h3>Staged installation</h3>

<p>The default way to install source packages changed in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 3.6.0, so
packages are first installed to a temporary location and then (if
successful) moved to the destination library directory.  Some older
packages were written in ways that assume direct installation to the
destination library.
</p>
<p>Staged installation can currently be overridden by having a line
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;StagedInstall: no&#8288;</span>&rsquo; in the package's &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file,
<em>via</em> flag <span class="option">--no-staged-install</span> or by setting environment
variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_STAGED</span> to a false value
(e.g. &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;false&#8288;</span>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;no&#8288;</span>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Staged installation requires either <span class="option">--pkglock</span> or
<span class="option">--lock</span>, one of which is used by default.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The options do not have to precede &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;pkgs&#8288;</span>&rsquo; on the command line,
although it will be more legible if they do.  All the options are
processed before any packages, and where options have conflicting
effects the last one will win.
</p>
<p>Some parts of the operation of <code>INSTALL</code> depend on the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
temporary directory (see <code>tempdir</code>, usually under
&lsquo;<span class="file">/tmp</span>&rsquo;) having both write and execution access to the account
running <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  This is usually the case, but if &lsquo;<span class="file">/tmp</span>&rsquo; has been
mounted as <code>noexec</code>, environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> may need
to be set to a directory from which execution is allowed.
