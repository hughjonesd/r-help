<h2 id='StructureClasses'>Classes Corresponding to Basic Structures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The virtual class <code>structure</code> and classes that
extend it are formal classes analogous to S language structures such
as arrays and time-series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## The following class names can appear in method signatures,
## as the class in as() and is() expressions, and, except for
## the classes commented as VIRTUAL, in calls to new()

"matrix"
"array"
"ts"

"structure" ## VIRTUAL
</code></pre>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>Objects can be created by calls of the form <code>new(Class, ...)</code>,
where <code>Class</code> is the quoted name of the specific class (e.g.,
<code>"matrix"</code>), and the other arguments, if any, are interpreted as
arguments to the corresponding function, e.g., to function
<code>matrix()</code>.  There is no particular advantage over calling those
functions directly, unless you are writing software designed to work
for multiple classes, perhaps with the class name and the arguments
passed in.
</p>
<p>Objects created from the classes <code>"matrix"</code> and <code>"array"</code> are unusual, to put
it mildly, and have been for some time.  Although they may appear to
be objects from these classes, they do not have the internal
structure of either an S3 or S4 class object.  In particular, they
have no <code>"class"</code> attribute and are not recognized as objects
with classes (that is, both <code>is.object</code> and
<code>isS4</code> will return <code>FALSE</code> for such objects).
</p>
<p>That the objects still behave as if they came from the corresponding
class (most of the time, anyway) results from special code
recognizing such objects being built into the base code of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.
For most purposes, treating the classes in the usual way will work,
fortunately.  One consequence of the special treatment is that these
two classes<em>may</em> be used as the data part of an S4 class; for
example, you can get away with <code>contains = "matrix"</code> in a call
to <code>setGeneric</code> to create an S4 class that is a subclass
of <code>"matrix"</code>.  There is no guarantee that everything will work
perfectly, but a number of classes have been written in this form
successfully.
</p>
<p>The class <code>"ts"</code>  is basically an S3 class
that has been registered with S4, using the
<code>setOldClass</code> mechanism.  Versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> through 2.7.0
treated this class as a pure S4 class, which was in principal a good
idea, but in practice did not allow subclasses to be defined and had
other intrinsic problems.  (For example, setting the
<code>"tsp"</code> parameters as a slot often fails because the built-in
implementation does not allow the slot to be temporarily
inconsistent with the length of the data. Also, the S4 class
prevented the correct specification of the S3 inheritance for class
<code>"mts"</code>.)
</p>
<p>The current behavior (beginning with version 2.8.0 of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>) registers
<code>"ts"</code> as an S3 class,  using an S4-style definition (see the
documentation for <code>setOldClass</code> in the examples section
for an abbreviated listing of how this is done.  The S3
inheritance of <code>"mts"</code> in package <code>stats</code> is also
registered.
These classes, as well as <code>"matrix"</code> and <code>"array"</code> should
be valid in most examples as superclasses for new S4 class
definitions.
</p>


<h3>Extends</h3>

<p>The specific classes all extend class <code>"structure"</code>, directly, and
class <code>"vector"</code>, by class <code>"structure"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt>coerce</dt><dd><p>Methods are defined to coerce arbitrary objects to
these classes, by calling the corresponding basic function, for
example, <code>as(x, "matrix")</code> calls <code>as.matrix(x)</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ops, Math</dt><dd><p>Group methods (see, e.g., <code>S4groupGeneric</code>)
are defined for combinations of structures and vectors (including
special cases for array and matrix), implementing the concept of
vector structures as in the reference.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>showClass("structure")

## explore a bit :
showClass("ts")
(ts0 &lt;- new("ts"))
str(ts0)

showMethods("Ops") # six methods from these classes, but maybe many more
