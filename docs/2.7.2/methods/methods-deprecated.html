<h2>Deprecated Functions in Methods package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions are provided for compatibility with older versions of
<span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> only, and may be defunct as soon as the next release.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>getAllMethods(f, fdef, where)
mlistMetaName (name, package)
removeMethodsObject(f, where)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original help page for these functions is often
available at <code>help("oldName-deprecated")</code> (note the quotes).
Functions in packages other than the methods package are listed in
<code>help("pkg-deprecated")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Summary of Functions</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>getAllMethods</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>This function replicates the behavior of
<code>getMethods</code>, which should be called instead to obtain
approximately the old behavior of <code>getAllMethods</code>.  However, a
better substitution is to use <code>findMethods</code>, which
returns a simpler structure.
</p>
<p>(The following is the original description, which has not been
accurate since approximately version 2.5.0 of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.) 
</p>
<p>A generic function (with methods) representing the merge of all
the methods defined for this generic starting from environment
<code>where</code>, including all parent environments.  By default,
uses the global environment (and therefore all packages on the
search list).  This function exists largely
to re-compute the full set of methods when a change to the
available methods occurs.  Since all such recomputations are
supposed to be automatic, direct calls to <code>getAllMethods</code>
should not be needed.
</p>
<p>If the generic <code>f</code> has a group generic, methods for this
group generic (and further generations of group generics, if any)
are also merged.
</p>
<p>The merging rule is as follows: each generic is merged across
packages, and the group generics are then merged, finally adding
the directly defined methods of <code>f</code>.
</p>
<p>The effect of the merging rule is that any method directly defined
for <code>f</code> on any included package overrides a method for the
same signature defined for the group generic; similarly for the
group generic and its group, if any, etc.
</p>
<p>For <code>f</code> or for a specific group generic, methods override in
the order of the packages being searched.  A method for a
particular signature on a particular package overrides any methods
for the same signature on packages later on in the list of
packages being searched.
</p>
<p>The slot <code>"allMethods"</code> of the merged methods list is set to
a copy of the methods slot; this is the slot where inherited
methods are stored.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mlistMetaName</code>:</dt><dd><p>Utility to  return the mangled
name for the object that stored the <code>MethodsList</code>
representation of the methods for a particular generic function,
typically in the environment of a package.
</p>
<p>These objects are no longer used, and will likely not be generated
starting in version 2.8.0 of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>removeMethodsObject</code>:</dt><dd>
<p>remove the metadata object containing methods for <code>f</code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
