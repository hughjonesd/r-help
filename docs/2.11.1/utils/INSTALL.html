<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This will stop at the first error, so if you want all the <code>pkgs</code>
to be tried, call this via a shell loop.
</p>
<p>If used as <code>R CMD INSTALL pkgs</code> without explicitly specifying
<code>lib</code>, packages are installed into the library tree rooted at the
first directory in the library path which would be used by <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> run in
the current environment.
</p>
<p>To install into the library tree <code><var>lib</var></code>, use
<code>R CMD INSTALL -l <var>lib</var> <var>pkgs</var></code>.
This prepends <code>lib</code> to the library path for
duration of the install, so required packages in the installation
directory will be found (and used in preference to those in other
libraries).
</p>
<p>Both <code>lib</code> and the elements of <code>pkgs</code> may be absolute or
relative path names of directories.  <code>pkgs</code> may also contain
names of package archive files: these are then extracted to a
temporary directory.  These are tarballs containing a single
directory, optionally compressed by <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>,
<code>xz</code> or <code>compress</code>.
Finally, binary package archive files (as created by
<code>R CMD INSTALL --binary</code>) can be supplied.
</p>
<p>Tarballs are by default unpackaged by the internal <code>tar</code>
function: if needed an external <code>tar</code> command can be specified
by the environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span>: please ensure that it
can handle the type of compression used on the tarball.
</p>
<p>The package sources can be cleaned up prior to installation by
<span class="option">--preclean</span> or after by <span class="option">--clean</span>: cleaning is
essential if the sources are to be used with more than one
architecture or platform.
</p>
<p>Some package sources contain a &lsquo;<span class="file">configure</span>&rsquo; script that can be
passed arguments or variables via the option <span class="option">--configure-args</span>
and <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, respectively, if necessary.  The latter
is useful in particular if libraries or header files needed for the
package are in non-system directories.  In this case, one can use the
configure variables <code>LIBS</code> and <code>CPPFLAGS</code> to specify these
locations (and set these via <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>), see section
&ldquo;Configuration variables&rdquo; in &ldquo;R Installation and
Administration&rdquo; for more information.  (If these are used more than
once on the command line they are concatenated.)  The configure
mechanism can be bypassed using the option <span class="option">--no-configure</span>.
</p>
<p>If the attempt to install the package fails, leftovers are removed.
If the package was already installed, the old version is restored.
This happens either if a command encounters an error or if the
install is interrupted from the keyboard: after cleaning up the script
terminates.
</p>
<p>By default the library directory is &lsquo;locked&rsquo; by creating a
directory &lsquo;<span class="file">00LOCK</span>&rsquo; within it.  This has two purposes: it
prevents any other process installing into that library concurrently,
and is used to store any previous version of the package to
restore on error.  A finer-grained locking is provided by the option
<span class="option">--pkglock</span> which creates a separate lock for each
package: this allows enough freedom for careful parallel
installation as done by <code>install.packages(Ncpus =
  <var>n</var>)</code> with <code><var>n</var> &gt; 1</code>.  Finally locking (and restoration
on error) can be suppressed by <span class="option">--no-lock</span> or <span class="option">--unsafe</span>
(two names for the same option).
</p>
<p>Some platforms (notably Mac OS X) support sub-architectures in which
binaries for different CPUs are installed within the same library
tree. For such installations, the default behaviour is to try to build
packages for all installed sub-architectures unless the package has a
configure script or a &lsquo;<span class="file">src/Makefile</span>&rsquo;, when only the
sub-architecture running <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> is used.  To use only
that sub-architecture, use <span class="option">--no-multiarch</span>.  To install just
the compiled code for another sub-architecture, use
<span class="option">--libs-only</span>.
</p>
<p>Use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code> for concise usage information,
including all the available options
</p>


<h3>Packages using the methods package</h3>

<p>Packages that require the methods package and make use functions such
as <code>setMethod</code> or <code>setClass</code>, should be
installed using lazy-loading: use the field <code>LazyLoad</code> in the
&lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file to ensure this.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some parts of the operation of <code>INSTALL</code> depend on the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
temporary directory (see <code>tempdir</code>, usually under
&lsquo;<span class="file">/tmp</span>&rsquo;) having both write and execution access to the account
running <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  This is usually the case, but if &lsquo;<span class="file">/tmp</span>&rsquo; has been
mounted as <code>noexec</code>, environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> may need
to be set to a directory from which execution is allowed.
