<h2>Invoke a System Command</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>system</code> invokes the OS command specified by <code>command</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>system(command, intern = FALSE,
       ignore.stdout = FALSE, ignore.stderr = FALSE,
       wait = TRUE, input = NULL, show.output.on.console = TRUE,
       minimized = FALSE, invisible = TRUE, timeout = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="command">command</code></td>
<td>
<p>the system command to be invoked, as a character string.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intern">intern</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical (not <code>NA</code>) which indicates whether to
capture the output of the command as an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> character vector.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ignore.stdout">ignore.stdout</code>, <code id="ignore.stderr">ignore.stderr</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical (not <code>NA</code>)
indicating whether messages written to &lsquo;<span class="file">stdout</span>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<span class="file">stderr</span>&rsquo; should be ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wait">wait</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical (not <code>NA</code>) indicating whether the <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
interpreter should wait for the command to finish, or run it
asynchronously.  This will be ignored (and the interpreter will
always wait) if <code>intern = TRUE</code>. When running the command
asynchronously, no output will be displayed on the <code>Rgui</code>
console in Windows (it will be dropped, instead).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="input">input</code></td>
<td>
<p>if a character vector is supplied, this is copied one
string per line to a temporary file, and the standard input of
<code>command</code> is redirected to the file.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="timeout">timeout</code></td>
<td>
<p>timeout in seconds, ignored if 0.  This is a limit for the
elapsed time running <code>command</code> in a separate process.  Fractions
of seconds are ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="show.output.on.console">show.output.on.console</code>, <code id="minimized">minimized</code>, <code id="invisible">invisible</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments
that are accepted on Windows but ignored on this platform, with a
warning.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This interface has become rather complicated over the years: see
<code>system2</code> for a more portable and flexible interface
which is recommended for new code.
</p>
<p><code>command</code> is parsed as a command plus arguments separated by
spaces.  So if the path to the command (or a single argument such as a
file path) contains spaces, it must be quoted e.g. by
<code>shQuote</code>.
</p>
<p>Unix-alikes pass the command line to a shell (normally &lsquo;<span class="file">/bin/sh</span>&rsquo;,
and POSIX requires that shell), so <code>command</code> can be anything the
shell regards as executable, including shell scripts, and it can
contain multiple commands separated by <code>;</code>.
</p>
<p>On Windows, <code>system</code> does not use a shell and there is a separate
function <code>shell</code> which passes command lines to a shell.
</p>
<p>If <code>intern</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then <code>popen</code> is used to invoke the
command and the output collected, line by line, into an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
<code>character</code> vector.  If <code>intern</code> is <code>FALSE</code> then
the C function <code>system</code> is used to invoke the command.
</p>
<p><code>wait</code> is implemented by appending <code>&amp;</code> to the command: this
is in principle shell-dependent, but required by POSIX and so widely
supported.
</p>
<p>When <code>timeout</code> is non-zero, the command is terminated after the given
number of seconds.  The termination works for typical commands, but is not
guaranteed: it is possible to write a program that would keep running
after the time is out.  Timeouts can only be set with <code>wait = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>Timeouts cannot be used with interactive commands: the command is run with
standard input redirected from <code>/dev/null</code> and it must not modify
terminal settings.  As long as tty <code>tostop</code> option is disabled, which
it usually is by default, the executed command may write to standard
output and standard error.  One cannot rely on that the execution time of
the child processes will be included into <code>user.child</code> and
<code>sys.child</code> element of <code>proc_time</code> returned by <code>proc.time</code>. 
For the time to be included, all child processes have to be waited for by
their parents, which has to be implemented in the parent applications.
</p>
<p>The ordering of arguments after the first two has changed from time to
time: it is recommended to name all arguments after the first.
</p>
<p>There are many pitfalls in using <code>system</code> to ascertain if a
command can be run &mdash; <code>Sys.which</code> is more suitable.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>intern = TRUE</code>, a character vector giving the output of the
command, one line per character string.  (Output lines of more than
8095 bytes will be split on some systems.)
If the command could not be run an <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> error is generated.
</p>
<p>If <code>command</code> runs but gives a non-zero exit status this will be
reported with a warning and in the attribute <code>"status"</code> of the
result: an attribute <code>"errmsg"</code> may also be available.
</p>
<p>If <code>intern = FALSE</code>, the return value is an error code (<code>0</code>
for success), given the invisible attribute (so needs to be printed
explicitly).  If the command could not be run for any reason, the
value is <code>127</code> and a warning is issued (as from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 3.5.0).
Otherwise if <code>wait = TRUE</code> the value is the exit status returned
by the command, and if <code>wait = FALSE</code> it is <code>0</code> (the
conventional success value).
</p>
<p>If the command times out, a warning is reported and the exit status is
<code>124</code>.
</p>


<h3>Stdout and stderr</h3>

<p>For command-line <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>, error messages written to &lsquo;<span class="file">stderr</span>&rsquo; will be
sent to the terminal unless <code>ignore.stderr = TRUE</code>.  They can be
captured (in the most likely shells) by
</p>
<pre>    system("some command 2&gt;&amp;1", intern = TRUE)
</pre>
<p>For GUIs, what happens to output sent to &lsquo;<span class="file">stdout</span>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<span class="file">stderr</span>&rsquo; if <code>intern = FALSE</code> is interface-specific, and it
is unsafe to assume that such messages will appear on a GUI console
(they do on the macOS GUI's console, but not on some others).
</p>


<h3>Differences between Unix and Windows</h3>

<p>How processes are launched differs fundamentally between Windows and
Unix-alike operating systems, as do the higher-level OS functions on
which this <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> function is built.  So it should not be surprising that
there are many differences between OSes in how <code>system</code> behaves.
For the benefit of programmers, the more important ones are summarized
in this section.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The most important difference is that on a Unix-alike
<code>system</code> launches a shell which then runs <code>command</code>.  On
Windows the command is run directly &ndash; use <code>shell</code> for an
interface which runs <code>command</code> <em>via</em> a shell (by default
the Windows shell <code>cmd.exe</code>, which has many differences from
a POSIX shell).
</p>
<p>This means that it cannot be assumed that redirection or piping will
work in <code>system</code> (redirection sometimes does, but we have seen
cases where it stopped working after a Windows security patch), and
<code>system2</code> (or <code>shell</code>) must be used on Windows.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> What happens to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> when not
captured depends on how <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> is running: Windows batch commands behave
like a Unix-alike, but from the Windows GUI they are
generally lost.  <code>system(intern = TRUE)</code> captures &lsquo;<span class="file">stderr</span>&rsquo;
when run from the Windows GUI console unless <code>ignore.stderr =
      TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The behaviour on error is different in subtle ways (and has
differed between <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> versions).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The quoting conventions for <code>command</code> differ, but
<code>shQuote</code> is a portable interface.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Arguments <code>show.output.on.console</code>, <code>minimized</code>,
<code>invisible</code> only do something on Windows (and are most relevant
to <code>Rgui</code> there).
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># list all files in the current directory using the -F flag
## Not run: system("ls -F")

# t1 is a character vector, each element giving a line of output from who
# (if the platform has who)
t1 &lt;- try(system("who", intern = TRUE))

try(system("ls fizzlipuzzli", intern = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE))
# zero-length result since file does not exist, and will give warning.
