<h2>Save R Objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>save</code> writes an external representation of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> objects to the
specified file.  The objects can be read back from the file at a later
date by using the function <code>load</code> (or <code>data</code> in some cases).
</p>
<p><code>save.image()</code> is just a short-cut for &lsquo;save my current
workspace&rsquo;,
i.e., <code>save(list = ls(all = TRUE), file = ".RData")</code>.  It is also what
happens with <code>q("yes")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>save(..., list = character(),
     file = stop("'file' must be specified"),
     ascii = FALSE, version = NULL, envir = parent.frame(),
     compress = !ascii, compression_level,
     eval.promises = TRUE, precheck = TRUE)

save.image(file = ".RData", version = NULL, ascii = FALSE,
           compress = !ascii, safe = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>the names of the objects to be saved (as symbols or
character strings).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="list">list</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing the names of objects to be
saved.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="file">file</code></td>
<td>
<p>a (writable binary-mode) connection or the name of the
file where the data will be saved (when tilde expansion
is done).  Must be a file name for <code>version = 1</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ascii">ascii</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, an ASCII representation of the data is
written.  The default value of <code>ascii</code> is <code>FALSE</code> which
leads to a binary file being written.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="version">version</code></td>
<td>
<p>the workspace format version to use.  <code>NULL</code>
specifies the current default format.  The version used from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
0.99.0 to <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 1.3.1 was version 1.  The default format as from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
1.4.0 is version 2.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="envir">envir</code></td>
<td>
<p>environment to search for objects to be saved.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="compress">compress</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical or character string specifying whether saving
to a named file is to use compression.  <code>TRUE</code> corresponds to
<code>gzip</code> compression, and (from <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 2.10.0) character strings
<code>"gzip"</code>, <code>"bzip2"</code> or <code>"xz"</code> specify the
type of compression.  Ignored when <code>file</code> is a connection
and for workspace format version 1.</p>
</td></tr> 
<tr><td><code id="compression_level">compression_level</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: the level of compression to be
used.  Defaults to <code>6</code> for <code>gzip</code> compression and to
<code>9</code> for <code>bzip2</code> or <code>xz</code> compression.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="eval.promises">eval.promises</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should objects which are promises be
forced before saving?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="precheck">precheck</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should the existence of the objects be
checked before starting to save (and in particular before opening
the file/connection)?  Does not apply to version 1 saves.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="safe">safe</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, a temporary file is used for
creating the saved workspace.  The temporary file is renamed to
<code>file</code> if the save succeeds.  This preserves an existing
workspace <code>file</code> if the save fails, but at the cost of using
extra disk space during the save.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The names of the objects specified either as symbols (or character
strings) in <code>...</code> or as a character vector in <code>list</code> are
used to look up the objects from environment <code>envir</code>.  By default
promises are evaluated, but if <code>eval.promises = FALSE</code>
promises are saved (together with their evaluation environments).
(Promises embedded in objects are always saved unevaluated.)
</p>
<p>All <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> platforms use the XDR (bigendian) representation of C ints and
doubles in binary save-d files, and these are portable across all <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
platforms.  (ASCII saves used to be useful for moving data between
platforms but are now mainly of historical interest.  They can be more
compact than binary saves where compression is not used, but are
almost always slower to both read and write: binary saves compress
much better than ASCII ones.)
</p>
<p>Default values for the <code>ascii</code>, <code>compress</code>, <code>safe</code> and
<code>version</code> arguments can be modified with the
<code>"save.defaults"</code> option (used both by <code>save</code> and
<code>save.image</code>), see also the &lsquo;Examples&rsquo; section.  If a
<code>"save.image.defaults"</code> option is set it is used in preference to
<code>"save.defaults"</code> for function <code>save.image</code> (which allows
this to have different defaults).
</p>
<p>A connection that is not already open will be opened in mode
<code>"wb"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Compression</h3>

<p>Large files can be reduced considerably in size by compression.  A
particular 46MB dataset was saved as 35MB without compression in 2
seconds, 22MB with <code>gzip</code> compression in 8 secs, 19MB with
<code>bzip2</code> compression in 13 secs and 9.4MB with <code>xz</code>
compression in 40 secs.  The load times were 1.3, 2.8, 5.5 and 5.7
seconds respectively.  These results are indicative, but the relative
performances do depend on the actual file and <code>xz</code> did
unusually well here.
</p>
<p>It is possible to compress later (with <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>
or <code>xz</code>) a file saved with <code>compress = FALSE</code>: the effect
is the same as saving with compression.  Also, a saved file can be
uncompressed and re-compressed under a different compression scheme
(and see <code>resaveRdaFiles</code> for a way to do so from within <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>).
</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>The <code>...</code> arguments only give the <em>names</em> of the objects
to be saved: they are searched for in the environment given by the
<code>envir</code> argument, and the actual objects given as arguments need
not be those found.
</p>
<p>Saved <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> objects are binary files, even those saved with
<code>ascii = TRUE</code>, so ensure that they are transferred without
conversion of end of line markers and of 8-bit characters.  The lines
are delimited by LF on all platforms.
</p>
<p>Although the default version has not changed since <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> 1.4.0, this
does not mean that saved files are necessarily backwards compatible.
You will be able to load a saved image into an earlier version of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
unless use is made of later additions (for example, raw vectors or
external pointers).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The most common reason for failure is lack of write permission in the
current directory.  For <code>save.image</code> and for saving at the end of
a session this will shown by messages like
</p>
<pre>    Error in gzfile(file, "wb") : unable to open connection
    In addition: Warning message:
    In gzfile(file, "wb") :
      cannot open compressed file '.RDataTmp',
      probable reason 'Permission denied'
</pre>
<p>The defaults were changed to use compressed saves for <code>save</code> in
2.3.0 and for <code>save.image</code> in 2.4.0.  Any recent version of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>
can read compressed save files, and a compressed file can be
uncompressed (by <code>gzip -d</code>) for use with very old versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>x &lt;- stats::runif(20)
y &lt;- list(a = 1, b = TRUE, c = "oops")
save(x, y, file = "xy.RData")
save.image()
unlink("xy.RData")
unlink(".RData")

# set save defaults using option:
options(save.defaults = list(ascii = TRUE, safe = FALSE))
save.image()
unlink(".RData")
