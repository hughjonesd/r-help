<h2>
Create a Tar Archive
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a tar archive.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>tar(tarfile, files = NULL,
    compression = c("none", "gzip", "bzip2", "xz"),
    compression_level = 6, tar = Sys.getenv("tar"),
    extra_flags = "")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="tarfile">tarfile</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pathname of the tar file: tilde expansion (see
<code>path.expand</code>) will be performed.  Alternatively, a
connection that can be used for binary writes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="files">files</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of filepaths to be archived:
the default is to archive all files under the current directory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="compression">compression</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string giving the type of compression to
be used (default none).  Can be abbreviated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="compression_level">compression_level</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: the level of compression.  Only used
for the internal method.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="tar">tar</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string: the path to the command to be used.  If
the command itself contains spaces it needs to be quoted &ndash; but
<code>tar</code> can also contain flags separated from the command by
spaces.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="extra_flags">extra_flags</code></td>
<td>
<p>any extra flags for an external <code>tar</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is either a wrapper for a <code>tar</code> command or uses an
internal implementation in <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span>.  The latter is used if <code>tarfile</code>
is a connection or if the argument <code>tar</code> is <code>"internal"</code> or
<code>""</code>.  Note that whereas Unix-alike versions of <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> set the
environment variable <span class="env">TAR</span>, its value is not the default for this
function.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>extra_flags</code> is passed to an external <code>tar</code> and
so is platform-dependent.  Possibly useful values include <span class="option">-h</span>
(follow symbolic links, also <span class="option">-L</span> on some platforms),
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;--acls&#8288;</span>&rsquo;, <span class="option">--exclude-backups</span>, <span class="option">--exclude-vcs</span> (and
similar) and on Windows <span class="option">--force-local</span> (so drives can be
included in filepaths: this is the default for the <code>Rtools</code>
<code>tar</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The return code from <code>system</code> or <code>0</code> for the internal
version, invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Portability</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;tar&rsquo; format no longer has an agreed standard!
&lsquo;Unix Standard Tar&rsquo; was part of POSIX 1003.1:1998 but has been
removed in favour of <code>pax</code>, and in any case many common
implementations diverged from the former standard.  Most <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> platforms
use a version of GNU <code>tar</code> (including <code>Rtools</code> on
Windows, but the behaviour seems to be changed with each version), Mac
OS 10.6 and FreeBSD use <code>bsdttar</code> from the &lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;libarchive
  project&#8288;</span>&rsquo;, and commercial Unixes will have their own versions.
</p>
<p>Known problems arise from
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The handling of file names of more than 100 bytes.  These were
unsupported in early versions of <code>tar</code>, and supported in one
way by POSIX <code>tar</code> and in another by GNU <code>tar</code>.  The
internal implementation uses the POSIX way which supports up to 255
bytes (depending on the path), and warns on paths of more than 100
bytes.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> (File) links.  <code>tar</code> was developed on an OS that used
hard links, and physical files that were referred to more than one
in the list of files to be included were included only once, the
remaining instance being added as links.  Later a means to include
symbolic links was added.  The internal implementation supports
symbolic links (on OSes that support them), only.  Of course, the
question arises as to how links should be unpacked on OSes that do
not support them: for files at least file copies can be used.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Header fields, in particular the padding to be used when
fields are not full or not used.  POSIX did define the correct
behaviour but commonly used implementations did (and still do)
not comply.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For portability, avoid file paths of more than 100 bytes, and links
(or at least, hard links and symbolic links to directories).
</p>
<p>The internal implementation writes only the blocks of 512 bytes
required, unlike GNU <code>tar</code> which by default pads with
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;nul&#8288;</span>&rsquo; to a multiple of 20 blocks (10KB).  Implementations differ
to whether the block padding should occur before or after compression
(or both).
