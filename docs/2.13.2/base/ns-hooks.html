<h2 id='ns-hooks'>Hooks for Name Space events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Packages with namespaces can supply functions to be called when
loaded, attached or unloaded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>.onLoad(libname, pkgname)
.onAttach(libname, pkgname)
.onUnload(libpath)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="ns-hooks_:_libname">libname</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the library directory where
the package defining the namespace was found.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ns-hooks_:_pkgname">pkgname</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the name of the package.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ns-hooks_:_libpath">libpath</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the complete path to the package.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions apply only to packages with namespaces.
</p>
<p>After loading, <code>loadNamespace</code> looks for a hook function
named <code>.onLoad</code> and calls it (with two unnamed arguments) before
sealing the namespace and processing exports.
</p>
<p>When the package is attached (via <code>library</code> or
<code>attachNamespace</code>), the hook function <code>.onAttach</code> is
looked for and if found is called (with two unnamed arguments) before
the package environment is sealed.
</p>
<p>If a function <code>.Last.lib</code> is exported in the package, it
will be called (with a single argument) when the package is detached.
Beware that it might be called if <code>.onAttach</code> has failed, so it
should be written defensively.  (It is called within
<code>try</code>, so errors will not stop the package being
detached.)
</p>
<p>If a namespace is unloaded (via <code>unloadNamespace</code>), a hook
function <code>.onUnload</code> is run (with a single argument) before final
unloading.
</p>
<p>Note that the code in <code>.onLoad</code> and <code>.onUnload</code> is run
without the package being on the search path, but (unless circumvented)
lexical scope will make objects in the namespace and its imports
visible.  (Do not use the double colon operator in <code>.onLoad</code> as
exports have not been processed at the point it is run.)
</p>
<p>When the package is attached (via <code>library</code>), the hook
function <code>.onAttach</code> is looked for and if found is called
after the exported functions are attached and before the package
environment is sealed.  This is less likely to be useful than
<code>.onLoad</code>, which should be seen as the analogue of
<code>.First.lib</code> (which is only used for packages without a
namespace).
</p>
<p><code>.onLoad</code>, <code>.onUnload</code> and <code>.onAttach</code> are looked for
as internal objects in the namespace and should not be exported
(whereas <code>.Last.lib</code> should be).
</p>
<p>If a function <code>.Last.lib</code> is visible in the package, it
will be called when the package is detached: this does need to be exported.
</p>
<p>Anything needed for the functioning of the namespace should be
handled at load/unload times by the <code>.onLoad</code> and
<code>.onUnload</code> hooks.  For example, DLLs can be loaded (unless done
by a <code>useDynLib</code> directive in the &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; file) and
initialized in <code>.onLoad</code> and unloaded in <code>.onUnload</code>.  Use
<code>.onAttach</code> only for actions that are needed only when the
package becomes visible to the user, for example a start-up message.
</p>


<h3>Good practice</h3>

<p>Loading a namespace should where possible be silent, with startup
messages given by <code>.onAttach</code>.  These messages (and any essential
ones from <code>.onLoad</code>) should use <code>packageStartupMessage</code>
so they can be silenced where they would be a distraction.
</p>
<p>There should be no calls to <code>library</code> nor <code>require</code> in these
hooks.  The way for a package to load other packages is via the
&lsquo;<span class="samp">&#8288;Depends&#8288;</span>&rsquo; field in the &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file: this ensures
that the dependence is documented and packages are loaded in the
correct order.  Loading a namespace should not change the search path,
so rather than attach a package, dependence of a namespace on another
package is best achieved by (selectively) importing from the other
package's namespace.
