This repository provides R help files for previous version of R, using the
[git copy of the R source](https://github.com/wch/r-source).

Help for old versions of R is not guaranteed to show correctly, because the .Rd 
specification may have changed.

A **very** simple index file is available for every R version.

# R versions

```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE}
rv <- list.files("docs", include.dirs = TRUE)
cat(paste0("* [", rv, "](https://hughjonesd.github.io/r-help/", rv, "/00index.html)\n"))
```
